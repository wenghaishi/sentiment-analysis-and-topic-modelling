Am here at Cedele Raffles City.  Noisy crowd and full house but floor staff of 3 led by Sara are doing a great job of systematically serving and clearing tables. Well done!,4
A chill place to relax with friends and catch up on lost time. The cake here is decent but I wouldn't say it was the best. Staff here are friendly and take orders quickly.,4
