Food quality can be great one time and super low during peak periods like lunchtime. Pasta overcooked and wet was the worst. Kitchen is super inconsistent. Not sure if there is a change in staffing.  Used to prefer this branch every weekend …,2
"Food is disappointing, oily and not of a good quality product. This is not worth better than fast food in mac donald.",2
"3 staffs were at the counter but only one was working, trying to juggle with 3 jobs - cashiering, packing, cake cutting. Others were just loitering around or busy with their phones rather than helping the poor girl at the cashier. Visit only if you have a lot of time abs patience to spare.",2

I live around the area and I eat at Cedele a lot. The food is pretty good here but the service is atrocious. Staff are all very rude and unfriendly. Don’t think they actually understand what customer service is.,2
The service is rather poor. Curt staff that made me shift a smaller table beside me whilst I was eating because of “peak hour”. Yet the cafe was half filled at 6pm while i was eating (on the table of 4) and half filled when I left. …,2

Service quality and food quality is quite poor. Staff on duty this morning is not friendly. Food took 15mins to arrive even though the place had little crowd. This outlet needs a quality check.,2

The food was good tho the service was bad. The food took 30 minutes plus after 2 follow ups on how long our food will take. Needs more staff that know what they are doing,2
"Appalling experience, staff didn’t serve us clean drinking water and refused to let us bring water from outside.",2
"Poor experience here. Arrived at 915, told later that kitchen opened at 930, and food arrived at 10am. It's really a restaurant that opens at 10. The food is ok but overpriced.",2
They ran out of lemons with a cold storage in the same building that's not a good reason not to be able to serve ice lemon tea.,2

Waiting time is too long.,2
Slow,2
This branch is so so. I love Cedele but unfortunately staff is not train properly how to deal with customers. Food assembly was also very poor and little. Disappointed a bit after buying from them for years( my wraps were half empty). If i want to eat empty wraps i can get prata for 2$.,2

Quite a shame.",2

Very rude service staff. I am a regular customer. The usual lady staff is pleasant. But there was a male service staff today and he was very rude. Never had such an unpleasant experience before. I am shocked by his poor attitude. He tore up the qr code sticker that was right in front of me and threw it onto the ground.,2
Celede new outlet at Paragon basement food hall. To me the Cedele brand has declined. The service and staff working attitude is poor. The food is ot as delicious as before.,2

There's a sign ""Please wait to be seated"", which I queued behind it for more than 5mins, & your staff chose to serve the pair who ""waited inside first"". I'm pretty sure they came after me,& walked straight in. I left immediately, and certainly not going back again.",2
Stayed here for tea time and tried their Eggless chocolate truffle cake. I was amazed by how delicious and creamy this cake is. I believe its a no-bake cake and the chocolate just melts in your mouth.,2

"1. I sat for a cup of tea while waiting for my friend to join. The loud chit chatting loudly amongst the counter staff  are quite disturbing.
2. Lady who took my order is curt and unhelpful (like I should know their menu …",2
I have always been a fan of cedele so I decide to try the new outlet at republic plaza. However the quality is below expectation. The green tea soba is way too salty. I practically left the all of them untouched. I am very disappointed with the quality of food served at this outlet.,2
"A fan of Cedele. I came here to celebrate birthday with my friend. The coffee was great as usual. However, the caramel sea salt tiramisu cake was not upto the mark. It was loaded with sugar unlike other Cedele cakes. I'm disappointed :(",2
"Rude and mediocre.

But all of Cedele branches are like this",2
"DISAPPOINTING MEAL ! ! We ordered the vegan burger, Burmese tofu and truffle fries. The vegan patty between the 2 slices of bread was so dry and tasteless. The so-called Burmese tofu were but a few pieces of deep fried tofu on some very …",2
"Disappointed. Taking order is slow. Also, wrong priority as there were a lot of people waiting for the coffee and they prioritized an order change (from a served slim milk coffee to a full cream milk coffee) from a serviced customer and let …",2
Chanced upon this branch and had garlic chicken and salad for lunch. The chicken is nice and salad ingredients very unique. So you would guess it’s intention was healthy food. No! The chicken and salad was splashed with so much oil that I have to avoid it. Just wonder if owner cares as I noticed a lot of bad reviews too,2
Not impressed with the burger. It was more of a sandwich and the amount of avacado provided was v little and the chicken was hard. I will not recommend this particular dish. I believe anyone could have made a better burger/ sandwich. What was nice was that you can help yourself to some slices of bread to dip in olive oil,2
Its a tiny place with limited sittings. Took the mango lassi- yogurt drink(nice & not the over sweet type) with a cranberry scone. I would prefer the scone to be more biscuit like texture. Used to have flourless cake. Hope it'll return.,2
"Food is good, but the service is atrocious. Saw staff sitting and taking up space during their break when customers were looking for places to sit. Also, way too few staff on site to manage the crowd.",2
Had many visits before but surprisingly food is not what i have been had today. Soup is cold and bread is utterly dry. and i am seeing some ants on my table. Sorry but i dont think i would come anymore,2
The store manager and staff are incredibly slow and Bo chap. At first I thought there were many customers but it turns out they're just inefficient. Surprised cedele set such standards,2
Soup was cold. Had to ask them to heat it up. Pasta was abysmal too. Didn't taste as gd as b4. Sad.,2
Poor counter service. Definitely not the place for a working lunch. No wifi or even a plug point to charge your devices.,2
Service time is too slow......,2
Very small outlet with minimal staff. Take sometime to process the orders.,2
The barista doesn’t handle well with crowds. Got my orders mixed up.,2
"3.80 for an espresso that was lukewarm, not worth it.",2
Very small space and limited seating.,2
Standard of food has dropped. The chicken is dry and tasteless. Mushroom soup seems watered down. Staff always seemed overworked. Please do something about the flies in the shop. I see some flying around and even in the bread display.,2
"Cedele/ toss&turn used to give complementary sliced bread/ rolls with their soups, it was a nice welcoming touch. They have  stopped doing so.. pity.",2
The strawberry tart is not fresh and the staff had no attentive to my order. Miss out one order and to order again. Hope it will not happen again. As I can understand the working hours.,2
"I used to enjoy Cedele's salads.  Sadly, their salad bowls are quite disappointingly meagre now.  It used to be brimming over with ingredients topped with a generous lashings of a choice of lovely salad dressings.  Furthermore, customers …",2
"Huge tasty portions. Operated by folks from CEDELE, thus also serves up their scrumptious selection of cakes. Unfortunately dour service.",2
"Super slow staff and not helpful at all. Although the food it is okay, only some comments on the hygiene and need to wash their hands more often when preparing other meals must be done better as they serve fresh ingredients. …",2
"Overpriced bowl of veggies, less than average freshness. Some staff are not very friendly. Dont waste money on salad here, go down to NTUC to buy vegetables instead.",2
"Price increased for customised own salad. Most choices must pay extra!
Taste is average.
Staff is below average.
Will not go back again!",2
Not very helpful staff,2
"i’ve always loved the bread here but today when I went to buy the bread, i encountered a rude indian cashier, didnt want to slice my long loaf of ciabatta for me and scolded other customers for queueing wrongly (the queue was pretty weird …",2
"(Translated by Google) The scones don't taste very good, they don't want to visit again... …",2
"Disappointed. Sticky honey wing.. should be renamed sour honey wings. Overdid on the lemon .. For our visit they missed out the wings and kids meal..which only arrived after adults finished eating.
Kids burger had zero greens.",2
"I’ve always come to Cedele only for cakes and coffee in the past. But recently, as we were browsing the menu at Wheelock, we were enticed to order what we spied on a diner’s table - what looked like a messy but yummy bunch of fried delish …",2
"Cedele has been one of my favourite places but the unpredictable service and low food quality was quite alarming. We went there around 4pm and the service was slow. It was really hard to get the attention of the service staff, to serve us …",2
"We had our staff gathering there on 23 Jul 20. The above ratings are for the food which are reasonably priced and palatable. However, i was not very happy with the guy at the pastry counter. He adamantly ignored us despite our attempts to get his attention so that we can order our desserts. Not a very friendly service team.",2
"I am not coming back here again. This being a Cedele restaurant, I had high hopes for it. The food does live up to it's reputation but the service is really disappointing. …",2
"Went at 11am when they open. Waiting time was reasonable. Food was great but service could be better given that there wasn't many customers.
Still will return as we love the Full Breakfast",2
"The  service ,  hygiene and attitude of the workers are so bad that perhaps it's due to shortage of staff . …",2
"I dunno how this place survives. I was standing at the door for forever and no one seated me, staff was just chatting among themselves. I wanted to leave but thought to give them a chance. In the end I was seated but no one took my order. In the end I left, don’t think anyone realized too.",2
"Pay high with low quality food and drink while way down under at customer service i.e. a kind of rude (ignorance with inattentive), poor handling at serving and irresponsive. …",2
"Cedele has always been one of my favourite places....until I went to this one at Wheelock Place.  The quality of the food was not up to par with other branches.  We were served cold fries and the beef sandwich was mediocre.  Moreover, the service was horrendous.  Both the waiter and waitress were unfriendly and grumpy.",2
Good food but TERRIBLE service from a rude and nasty waitress with short hair named Yen. Very bad attitude which ruined dining experience.,2
"Food was mediocre. Somehow, was not like before. I prefer other branch now. Staff was polite enough. Will take a while before I return.",2
"I had hot drinks and cake. Service was not professional, service staff needs training.",2
"Not my first, but definitely my last visit to this outlet. Poor service and poor food quality, what a pity, they used to be decent.",2
Too expensive for its quality and poor service.,2
"Unlike other cedele outlets, have to pay service charge at this outlet, but service slower than the other outlets. Did not provide serviette.",2
"Just stay away from the French Toast($16), they were cold and soggy, the toast were probably prepared in a batch before hand and not made on the spot when you order.",2
"Missed the yummy food and good membership bonuses, now it's all gone its really gone down the drain.",2
Service is very poor at the cafe.  Had to chase people down to make an order.,2
Service not so friendly.,2
