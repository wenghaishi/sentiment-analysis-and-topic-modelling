Their hearty breakfast never fails at anytime of the day. Grilled seabass is well grilled and the curry sauce matches the fish. Their ginger tea and cauliflower soup is a must try!

Our most favourite branch for Cedele. Tried several branding under Cedele but this branch service was still the best. Our kids love their mushroom soup and they serve free flow of bread if you order soup. Their staff here are more friendly and attentive too. Our favourite cake was their walnut carrot cake and Matcha green tea cake.,5
Do not expect restaurant style services but food is ok. Just sharing a photo taken outside of Cedele on an Awesome evening.,3

"Good bread and average coffee. Staff indifferent to the point of rudeness. It's that Singapore thing where they believe if they are unsmiling and uncommunicative, this somehow translates to efficiency. It doesn't - it's just a lack of customer service skills. Bread is just about worth it though...",3

Their bread is fresh and there is a good flow of customers to ensure that what is made is sold quickly... I look at that to get peace of mind that I will not be given items that have been sitting on the shelf for a long time.",4

The Cedele at City square is a decent cosy place. Food is good. There are good varieties in their cakes and pasteries selection but I feel their new selection (cakes) pieces are very small cuts compared to their old ones like the carrot and red velvet cakes. It's not worth the money we pay for the slices. $8.50 per piece.,3

Yuzu cheesecake is good but small portion.
Chai latte was horrendous... It was just a tea bag and steamed milk",3

The food was good tho the service was bad. The food took 30 minutes plus after 2 follow ups on how long our food will take. Needs more staff that know what they are doing,2

Very poor etiquette, zero service standards",1
This branch is so so. I love Cedele but unfortunately staff is not train properly how to deal with customers. Food assembly was also very poor and little. Disappointed a bit after buying from them for years( my wraps were half empty). If i want to eat empty wraps i can get prata for 2$.,2

No thank u n I regret signing up for Ur membership",1

Service was on the slower side though there wasn’t much crowd during lunch. Protein bowl was pretty tasty. Chicken and the falafels were good. More salad dressing would be better.,3
Food taste not bad..if you come at weekend will queue to take a seat.. service oke,3
I like carrot cakes the most among the rest. Sandwiches are also good. Though it is a bit expensive.,4
Very bad customer service.. Staffs are so rude especially the one in the coffee counter.. she spolied our day with her attitude when we asked for sugar pockets. …,1
Very rude staff. Charged extra amount for the food and unruly behaviour.,1
"Food and service are, per Cedele standard, very good. But probably due to the busyness of the lunch time crunch, many tables were not cleared. Maybe they should consider putting up a sign to ask patrons to help clear their own used crockery and cutlery.",3
Today had a very bad experience and staffs are very rude especially coffee making staff.Really very bad service.,1
"being a cedele member, it's my go-to place. like the salmon sandwich thin and the vegan burger options. salad is meh. for cakes: red velvet, carrot walnut and matcha chocolate cake. for cupcakes: peanut butter and pandan cupcakes . their apple and pear crumbles are great too. good place for a dessert lover like myself.",4
Service is super horrible. Extremely rude people. They are surely spoiling brand of Cedele with their God awful and extremely  rude and unprofessional service. Go anywhere else,1
Food doesn’t taste well,2
Good enough. Not great.,3
"bad service, the staff was rude too.",1
Very disappointed with this branch. Ordered some breakfast treats via Deliveroo. The cake came melted. The 2 blueberry crumble muffins are completely different - 1 is burnt as well.,1
"Disappointed. Had to say our order 3 times to be understood. The order was the roasted cauliflower soup. When asking the staff of my bread could be toasted, the reply: ‘no we don’t toast the free bread’. How is the soup with bread free at just under 10dollars? Shocking.",2
I generally like cedele but at this branch staff is quite rude. They also stopped giving tap water and their drinks are quite expensive! Also on a very hilarious occasion: I bought sourdough bread and I asked the staff to slice it for me. …,2

"Served by two friendly n warm staffs.
Define a nice and quiet space to enjoy some personal time during the weekday. The sandwich portions were generous and ingredients used are fresh :)",4

"Very rude staff at the cashier.... I accidentally said paynow instead of paywave. And we apologised to the cashier multiple times. The cashier was clearly upset, black face and  gave an angry stare at us without any response.",1

"When dining in, tap water is not provided. Instead, the establishment pushes the purchase of bottled water, despite a sign inviting patrons to ”reduce plastic waste” by not using straws, also a single-use plastic product.",1
The staff who prepared the salads is careless and missed out on the protein in one of our takeaway salads. How are they expecting us to check through all the orders? Please be more careful next time.,2
"Nice services, nice Mocha and Gula Malaka Sponge Cake. � …",5
"The staff will make sure you are frustrated by their arrogance and sloppy service. Every time you order something, they will either not have some ingredient or miss something in your order or forget to tell you something right at the beginning. Dont expect to get the receipt unless you insist. Totally avoidable.",1
Always run out of main dish even at 1pm,1

"Good selection, quick and good service.
They have mince pies and other snacks for the Christmas period.",4
Rude staff,2

"Enjoyed my vegan salad bowl. $11.90 for a medium-sized bowl that comes with 2 choices of base (greens/cauliflower rice/quinoa) + 2 servings of protein +4 toppings.

"This breakfast was a small one which cost 8.50. Enjoyed the fresh croissant, scrambled eggs n 2 pieces Of rocket leaves. Bacon was over cooked. Very spacious but empty at 0830 (I wonder why?). Staff looked like they did not want to be …",4
The ondeh ondeh cake was pretty good. Have eaten at several Cedele branches over the years & so far I have had positive experiences. I do miss the pizza scones that they used to make.,4
Food and sandwiches are pretty decent in taste and quality. But things are a little overpriced considering the small portion sizes. $10.8 for a breakfast bagel deluxe seems to be on the pricey side.,3
"Their standard drop on the gourmet thins were not crispy as many years ago that I have ate. The skinny flat white is moderately good, coffee taste was still alright.",4

The chocolate cake is light letting the chocolate be the star of the show.
Not sinfully sweet or unctuous , with the tinge of bitterness of dark chocolate. …",4

Had lunch at Cedele. Multiple vegetarian options which were all delicious. Prices are perhaps a bit higher than they should be.,4
"It's just okay. Pros, some good salads, healthy bowls and soups.
Cons, unfriendly staff, average tasting coffee/tea.
If you want to a eat a slice of cake then they will only give you from the ones …",3
Back again for a coffee break after lunching at nearby green dot. Another place recommended for their carrot cake. Ordering took quite a while as it was lunch hour. They served really good cakes.,4
"Place is small but quite comfy, they provide baby chair which is a plus point. I ordered burger, taste nice, and good portion size. I personally love the burger bun, which was recommended by their employee.",4
"Big fan for whole-wheat their sourdough .
I signed up for Membership for $25 and get $30 voucher .",5
The strawberry tart and matcha chocolate cake are my recommended to eat. It seems they are short handed. A little messy at the counter.,4
"The carrot cake is nice. But the size of the cakes seems to varies, got the last slice of the orh nee cake and got a slice that is small and not worth the cost.",3
(Prices in last photo) Sunday brunch - can always count on Cedele for a cup of aromatic flat white ☕️ and healthy meal � …,4
Chanced upon this branch and had garlic chicken and salad for lunch. The chicken is nice and salad ingredients very unique. So you would guess it’s intention was healthy food. No! The chicken and salad was splashed with so much oil that I have to avoid it. Just wonder if owner cares as I noticed a lot of bad reviews too,2
"The worst service. Told at 9:45am very curtly that the kitchen is only open at 10am, which is fine so I wait. I dutily order a coffee before ordering food at 10am. Only to wait *more than half an hour* for a plate of eggs and toast. …",1
"Went for a light tea time. Place was a little hot. Ordered the ondeh ondeh cake and it was alright. Also ordered the strawberry tart and it was not very nice. Tart was chunky and damp, filled with strawberry, slightly sour",3
Service was terrible. Came at 3.40pm but was told that the kitchen will open at 4pm. Waited till 4pm but was again told that the chef was not ready and we had to wait further. Staff was unapologetic and seemed disinterested to serve.,1
Nice cafe to chill out and have a coffee or a pasta. Really crowded on Sunday due to church but pretty alright any other time.,4
healthy ingredients can be found in their wide range of menu. Excellent place for coffee and tea.,5

The eggless chocolate cake is yummy! We had the last slide. Fudge cake taste close to dark choc,1
Cakes here are good however not the cheapest. Red velvet is my all time favourite.,4
"Very cozy place. Cake was on the more expensive side but was amazing. Recommends the carrot cake with walnut! Most cake have cheese cream in them, so if you're a cheese lover, this is a place for you.",4
Coffee is nice.  Ordered 2 milkshakes for kids. Bad Taste like milk with low end chocolate syrup. Pretty low standard milkshake for $8. They must remove milkshake menu or improve quality.,3
"This is one of the smaller branches where there is a smaller menu. But you can still get the soups that they are great at, as well as freshly made sandwiches, wraps and pastas. Make room for the breads and cakes.",4

"I were ordering our food from the counter staff Siti and she offered to renew my membership which had been expired. In the past, I was told multiple times that I had to do the renewal myself.

"Terrible grab food experience. Food that came was a far cry from the pictures and descriptions shown on the grab platform. Ordered grilled chicken with avocado served with tomato salsa, grilled zucchini and quinoa but what came instead was plain brown rice, some tough pieces of chicken and some unappetising tomatoes and lettuces.",1
Nice food. Variety of selection. Eat clean. Crowded as expected,4

Nice little bakery cafe. Can get busy around lunch.,4

Cedele is always a nice place to dine in. There is indoor and outdoor. Though it is more cramped than other outlets and there is an echo which I feel others can hear your conversations.,4
My 1st time at this place...nice and cosy venue to catch up with friends on a hot afternoon at 3.30 pm. My sister chose this venue to  meet and 3 of us (with my sister-in-law) had an hour plus of discussion. …,5
Best carrot walnut cake. Also adore the suji almond cake. It’s very lightly sweet with a hint of rose. Lots of veg and vegan options.,5
Not impressed with the burger. It was more of a sandwich and the amount of avacado provided was v little and the chicken was hard. I will not recommend this particular dish. I believe anyone could have made a better burger/ sandwich. What was nice was that you can help yourself to some slices of bread to dip in olive oil,2
Am appalled by the service or lack of it at Star Vista. Ordered food and drinks at 334pm. Staff only realised food wasn’t prepared when I enquired abt it at 406pm. Prawn salad served at 415pm. But our grilled chicken was served to another …,1
Lovely place to come on a Saturday morning. Great coffee and delicious cakes,5
"Healthy and yummy food, nice and fun menu. Gripe is that the burgers are really overpriced. Just a bit more substantial than a sandwich and with a few leaves on the side, but twice the price.",4
A nice place with various healthy food to choose from. Unfortunately limited numbernof seats available inside the store. However there more seats outside the store. It is near the road path to the car park so at peak hour may experience …,4

I love Cedele but this outlet always seem to have problems with service and maintaining a certain level of consistency for their food and coffee. The chain really need to invest in smarter ways of managing orders as long queues is a trademark of this outlet.,3
All are nice..felt the service could be better,4
Watery and tasteless pasta Alfredo combined with rude and poor counter service would have called for a 1 star rating. Only saving grace was the coffee which was served with no less than a clanging of the saucer on the tray. This is specific only to Star Vista branch. Have no issues at my usual branch.,1
Poor customer service. Because we sit outside table and  the stuff don’t even bother us and we have to take water ourself .  The presentation of food is not good and they even missed our order .,1

Staff were alright, at times friendly but other times dismissive.",3

Decent place for tea. Theor cakes always good.,4
The store manager and staff are incredibly slow and Bo chap. At first I thought there were many customers but it turns out they're just inefficient. Surprised cedele set such standards,2

I love coming here on Saturday morning for a good cup of coffee and a wonderful slice of cake. I love their Carrot Walnut Cake and Lemon Cloud Cake.,5

Standard of food has dropped. The chicken is dry and tasteless. Mushroom soup seems watered down. Staff always seemed overworked. Please do something about the flies in the shop. I see some flying around and even in the bread display.,2
"Cedele/ toss&turn used to give complementary sliced bread/ rolls with their soups, it was a nice welcoming touch. They have  stopped doing so.. pity.",2
The strawberry tart is not fresh and the staff had no attentive to my order. Miss out one order and to order again. Hope it will not happen again. As I can understand the working hours.,2
Terrible service. Unfriendly and unwelcoming. Better training required for its staff. Stood at the counter for 20mins and was completely ignored. Lucky for the company the food is good I guess…,1
Clean and not crowded. Their foods are around average. I value they have variety selection of cakes and bread loaves.,4
I came here three times at 7pm and always they say that it’s closed. Food isn’t available any time. Better to close than to open and have no food.,1
Queued for 10 min before being served. Wanted to buy baguette and garlic bread. Indian female staff was rude and  refused to slice baguette. In the end I had to give up buying the baguette. This is probably the only branch with rude staff …,1
The smoked salmon and broccoli was hard. Place was not crowded during lunch hr (1.30pm) Cost $14.80 with orange juice set,1

Service and food standards have dropped drastically when we visited on a Saturday night. We were served raw sweet potato in the salad and stale bread w the soup. I made a complain to the lady service staff who just mentioned to write in without even glancing at the food I brought infront of them or checking their own food. Pathetic!,1

A nice and quiet corner located on the 3rd level of Wheellock Place. I was there for high tea and the aet we ordered is good enough for 2 people. The cakes on the high tea set is delicious. The 2 burgers with grilled chicken with the sauces …,4
Brunch at Cedele on Sunday noon. Rather quiet as compared to neighbouring shopping malls. Environment was cosy and food was served promptly. Would be better if they can served iced or warm water FOC instead of charging.,3
"Seabass in bits and pieces for both the 2 orders made. Not properly grilled like before or it is just the problem of this outlet. Disappointing 😞
Further review after eating... very disappointing. Maybe only cakes are good for now. Cashier very unfriendly …",1

Kids burger had zero greens.",2

"We had our staff gathering there on 23 Jul 20. The above ratings are for the food which are reasonably priced and palatable. However, i was not very happy with the guy at the pastry counter. He adamantly ignored us despite our attempts to get his attention so that we can order our desserts. Not a very friendly service team.",2
"I am not coming back here again. This being a Cedele restaurant, I had high hopes for it. The food does live up to it's reputation but the service is really disappointing. …",2
"The environment is pretty nice. Service ok.
But the food is average.",3
I have always appreciated the healthy and yummy food served by Cedele and have been a member for a long time now. Membership costs $30 to renew and that came with benefits such as a slice of cake and 30% discount during birthday month …,5

Quiet place for cakes and coffee. Place is bright with natural light. The big windows makes the place bright. Giving it a very good view while enjoying ur coffee and cakes. Both day and night will give you a good view. Recommended if you wan a place to read or have some quiet time,4
"Food itself and the environment are nice and okay. But, the kitchen staff were unaware of the exact menu, and the server was confused and gave us the wrong information. Was hard to get services from any servers. No so pleasant experience to have on weekend lunches.",3
"Went at 11am when they open. Waiting time was reasonable. Food was great but service could be better given that there wasn't many customers.
Still will return as we love the Full Breakfast",2

Ambiance was cozy, good place for Bonding with friends  …",4
"Their new vegan menu is superb. Wide variety of delicious choices. We have tried the super green omelette, falafel burger and cauliflower two-ways. Will be back to try other dishes.",5
A good place to hv a tasty healthy meal without the crowd.  The prawn salad plus avocado & accompanied by Mushroom Soup makes for a good feel evening meal .,4
Their cakes are as nice as other outlets but I find this outlet less crowded hence would prefer this then the others. A quieter corner compare the other cafes in Orchard.,3
"I liked how they serve the bread (it's mostly self bar) and soup was good. They sereve the spaghetti as al dente, so if you want over boiled than that, you should ask them first. Also they have bruch menus like pancakes.",4
"Today we needed a late lunch Cedele has always been good, today did not disappoint. I had the steak burger NZ rib eye and the bun good quality bread and toasted properly. I liked the salad. The dressing and pumpkin seeds really worked.",4

One of the best pancakes I'd eaten - the taste of lemon in the pancakes makes it very refreshing so you won't feel sick of eating it with the sweet syrup and tasty granolas. The sausages that were add-on were fantastic as well. Ambiance was cozy too.,5
Love the food here. Service can sometimes be a little slow due to lack of staff.,4
"decent food with great desserts, lassi was little lacked of ""uhm"" in the flavor, maybe has too many ingredients and the matching of the ingredients",3
"Quiet Cafe in the orchard area. it has lots of seating area. I had an excellent red velvet cake (right level of moisture) and a tumeric honey latte (very interesting). They have other pastries, desserts and drinks options. A great place to seat and relax for a bit in the busy area of orchard road.",4
"The  service ,  hygiene and attitude of the workers are so bad that perhaps it's due to shortage of staff . …",2
"Place might be a bit understaffed. Hard to get service when needed. But they still provided everything properly. Food was okay, portion is a little smaller than expected though",3
Absolutely rubbish food and service! Every food item lacks flavour. Don’t even think of stepping inside the restaurant.,1
"Waited 30 mins for avo on toast.  When I asked the manager on the status of my order, he went off but never came back to update me on the status.  10 mins later I had to ask another staff.  At least she offered to give me soup for free.  No …",1
"I dunno how this place survives. I was standing at the door for forever and no one seated me, staff was just chatting among themselves. I wanted to leave but thought to give them a chance. In the end I was seated but no one took my order. In the end I left, don’t think anyone realized too.",2
"Very nice and cozy environment, great service :) cauliflower soup is so so, beet chai is so so, turmeric latte is better.",5
"Lackluster service. We actual could have walked out without paying. We stood for >5 mins just waiting to pay. No one at the cashier. And when we finally found someone, she asked us if we’d like to place our order. Clearly, no idea that we …",1
Quiet place for a weekday lunch but service is a little lack luster. Had the portobello and beef burger which was quite yummy and loved the caramelised onion.,3
"Love the bread and coffee here.. only thing is I do not like the wheat bread that was served with my burger..
Even though is a healthy option, I would prefer a plain old burger bun.. …",4
"The thing I loved most is that they give the initiative for us to customize our meal. To be honest, my FAVOURITE thing there  was the sweet potato fries!!! It was so amazing- Crunchy, delicious (obviously), sweet, it's doesn't even need any sauce!! I love it. The service is also not bad! Please go there and enjoy your meals~♡",5
Cosy environment with delicious high tea set for 2,4

The bread in the beef burger that I have ordered is burnt. The bread accompanied my soup is hard and cold. Disappointed with the standard. Don't recommend.,1
"Cedele has always been one of my favourite places....until I went to this one at Wheelock Place.  The quality of the food was not up to par with other branches.  We were served cold fries and the beef sandwich was mediocre.  Moreover, the service was horrendous.  Both the waiter and waitress were unfriendly and grumpy.",2
I go here often food is v good. Service is pathetic. There is typically 1 overworked waiter trying to serve everyone. The new counter staff is rude and passive aggressive. Some large lady called Sia or some such ignored me while I stood at …,1
"Friday night, way understaffed, they oversold all their desserts and it's currently a full house at 9pm with 3/4 of the tables waiting for desserts, which they don't have enough stock for and are now forced to sell the cakes from the front …",1
I can attest all the bad reviews about Cedele's service and the service crew. The worse the review the truer it is in fact. I will never give any cent of business to Cedele. So many other wholesome cake shops and dessert places around. You are so NOT worth it Cedele!,1
"We went Cedele at Star so disappointed with limited selection!
1) Lassi (Not Available)
2) Cookie and Cream Milkshake (Not Available) Only Strawberry flavour …",1
A nice and quiet place for brunch or tea time. Staff are friendly and services are prompt.,4
Nice and cosy ambience.  Ordered rosemary chicken for the first time and it is REALLY good. Would def go back again to try their special Christmas high tea which looks really instagramable.,4
Good food but TERRIBLE service from a rude and nasty waitress with short hair named Yen. Very bad attitude which ruined dining experience.,2

"Came here tonight for cakes and drinks. Severely understaffed. Took them 10 mins just to clear a table, while we stand at the table looking at the left overs. And the service staff walked away without placing new table mats and cutlery, as he was busy attending to other tables. The company can review the number of staff.",1
"Great spot for an afternoon tea. Service was quick and staff was helpful. Most importantly, the food was good, lovely cup of tea and nice coffee.  I have been a member of Cedele for many years and this will continue.",5
Nice place for dinner at cedele! The pork loin is tough though.,4
"Very quiet on a Sunday morning, Full Plate breakfast was good as was the other items we ordered. Very good English Breakfast tea. Quite expensive but enjoyable.",4
This is my family's favourite Cedele outlet because it is bigger and getting a table on a Sat morning is easier. My favourite eat here is the full works breakfast set. Adding on a piece if carrot cake would be perfect for me,5
"They have a set meal: soup, mains, and dessert for S$28++. I had a mushroom soup, pasta with fish in lemongrass sauce, and two scoops of ice cream with oat cookies. Overall, very good.",4

Great food and ambience. We were a bit neglected though. We weren't given utensils and service waters unlike the tables that sat before and after us.,4
Consistently good and in a nice area on Orchard. They're are countless franchises around here but this is one of my favourites. I but more expensive than the smaller version in your local mall but still reasonable. Recommended,5

I like how spacious the place is to dine in at if you want to find a not crowded place to hang out with your friends.,4
Nice cafe for gathering with friends,4
Great place. Personal favorite - beef bacon works sandwich on round rye or pumpkin bread. Looks like a burger and tastes better than many burgers in town.,5
