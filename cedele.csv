"Being a firm supporter of Cedele for many years for their wide range of delicious baked goods, breads and meals. This may not be the most classy or polished location, but the reliable food items are available and it’s a convenient location at an MRT station."

"Love ordering and collecting my cakes at this Cedele branch. The staff are polite, friendly and efficient. Glad that they opened a branch here. Thank you"
Quiet corner for a cuppa & snack/meal. Service is polite and respectful. The cakes- ondeh-ondeh & Gula melaka- are special & very tasty. Their organic expresso's are a good way to chill out.
"Decent coffees and nice cakes..but staff, could be a little less lazy. Uncleared tables aplenty and staff chatting away behind the counter."

Outlet is clean."
Felt that the sandwiches and the bagels weren't that great... rather dry and hard.

Their hearty breakfast never fails at anytime of the day. Grilled seabass is well grilled and the curry sauce matches the fish. Their ginger tea and cauliflower soup is a must try! A lot of healthy option meals are available. Free flow of sourdough bread available. Avoid lunch hours as the kitchen becomes very busy so the service lags.

Our most favourite branch for Cedele. Tried several branding under Cedele but this branch service was still the best. Our kids love their mushroom soup and they serve free flow of bread if you order soup. Their staff here are more friendly and attentive too. Our favourite cake was their walnut carrot cake and Matcha green tea cake.
Do not expect restaurant style services but food is ok. Just sharing a photo taken outside of Cedele on an Awesome evening.
The drinks are good. Had turmeric latte which is non caffeine. A bit too sweet though. Blue Berry tart is pretty good as well and doesn't break when cut. Quite sturdy
"Staff there had some issue with their POS system and hence ordering of food was taking awhile. Customer service was great, and upon chatting with them, realized the troubles they were dealing with, which contributed to the wait time. The staff there are friendly and hardworking.

Food is alright but customer service is abysmal. Elderly lady called Lucy is especially rude and should honestly not be in front of house with an attitude like that. …
Food is good and standard remains the same. The order taking staff (guy) is a real turn off. Customer service is bad and coming to this place to eat is like being treated like an army recruit in a cook house. Please improve!!!
Service is abysmal. Don't come here even if it's the last place with coffee in the neighborhood. Drink water instead.
"Poor service, staff attitude problem while serving hot coffee beside toddler when there is space to serve the other side. Pancakes served ugly, no plating and looks like a kid cooking"
Sell bagels but not cream cheese - paid or otherwise. Had to ask for butter. Bagel was cold so asked for it to be heated up (had to ask twice) When served it as hardly warm and inside was still cold. All served with a BIG scowl.
Having some hot cross buns for Easter. The Pandan coconut hot cross buns are really tasty after toasting in the toaster Gill for 10mins. But it's rather pricy because they are plain buns with no fillings inside.
"Nice place to eat and hang out. Mains are good and healthy, averaging around S$15. Love the cakes and coffee. One of the cheapest places to have a glass of wine, as well."
"Love the soup. $8.80 for a soup + free flow bread is worth it. But if you are coming here for the main courses, they are a little overpriced."
I live around the area and I eat at Cedele a lot. The food is pretty good here but the service is atrocious. Staff are all very rude and unfriendly. Don’t think they actually understand what customer service is.
Good food and great burgers. Drinks not great though and it is un-necessarily expensive.
"We're always here for mushroom soup (free flow bread), pesto thins, burger or pesto pasta, and blueberry lassi. Great family eatery."
Healthier choice. Friendly staff.
Air conditioning is weak. Food is ok. But not a good place to hang out at because of the lack of air con. It’s basically a green house with no ventilation.
"Was crowded during lunch hour understandably, but having to wait over 45mins for my take out was a tad long"
The cakes and coffee are good. Food too!
Good coffee but expensive place. Join member at $25 to enjoy 10% discount $30 welcome voucher

"one of the best cedele branches with ample seating space and good staff. The quality of the food is awesome too, considering you are paying very reasonable prices."
"Customer service is extremely poor. Staff at this outlet are very rude,  and dont even know how to smile. I have been to this outlet several times and have never been greeted politely."
They have amazing walnut brownies. All time favorite place for brownies.

Food is wayyyyyy overpriced! $11 for kids pasta and the portion is not even for kid who can eat slightly more. Staff are not friendly.

Service staff wanting to close early and not serving coffee or lattes at 8pm. Folks are still having dinner and they are already clearing up. Suggest not to ever come here if you want coffee or lattes with your meal. Certainly not coffee friendly place after 8pm.
Standard has dropped recently. You should try their pasta… it’s very undercooked and stiff. Beef burger used to be nice but now it’s not so flavourful. It’s a pity. Used to be my fav place to dine.
"The ambience is good and their cakes are good. We loved the ondeh ondeh cake and the blueberry crumble is good also. The cakes are light and fragrant, perfect to satisfy your sweets cravings. Their tea is splendid and overall a good place to chill."

Love their bakery and neighborhood's lively vibe here. But there is a need of staff training for sure. Every time I saw unpleasant customers because of the abrupt staffs. I also do not feel welcoming from the staffs all the times.
Very very bad serving size. We ordered for smoked salmon salad and seabass in curried veggies. But looked like they had only leftovers to give as fish. Just a small meagre piece. Very disappointed with cedele. We will never order again.
"Blueberry tart with tasteless blueberries, dough not crunchy at all, orange ginger drink watery, only cappuccino is good and way better than Starbucks (ok, not a very high bar)"
"Nice, quiet place. Food is good as usual. Service is a bit slow but courteous."
Came for breakfast today 25th Aug 2021 at 930am. The cashier taking my order is very unfriendly and I have to repeat my orders twice and even though I repeated twice she stills get my order wrong.

Food is good as always. Healthy and delish!
"Breakfast menu limited and very much Over Priced, Lunch not any better, Coffee is over priced, No WiFi and the Sofa seats old deteriorated and stained. This place is a real disappointment compared to other Cedele outlets."
This Cedele in HillV2 is my favourite! Healthy food & bakery!
"My lunch was served COLD. The rice was cold! And I told the staff that I will PICK UP my dapao after eating my lunch. So after my lunch, the staff said they will start cooking now! Terrible service!"
Ordered sea bass curry sauce was extremely small tiny piece of fish. Not even half a size from the what we saw in the menu. The broccoli with rotten didn’t clean properly. Need more improvement @ 2 HillV Cedele.
Simple healthy and hearty! That's what cedele is for me.... Love it!!
Food was average. Cake variety is good. Tea as usual my favourite. Surprised got crowd n mostly eating salads n veg. Healthy meal...
Is always a delight to eat at Cedele. Love their soups sandwiches and cakes. Even the breakfast items are great.
counter staff forever slow and no initiative for another staff to help out when Q is forming longer especially during peak time... and their slice cakes sizes is always differently cut in sizes as there's time when it was pathetically cut …
"efficient prompt service, healthy delicious food. the cakes and bread rarely disappoint. we ordered the gula melaka ondeh ondeh cake, the lemon cloud and the carrot cake... family favourites!"
Menu keeps changing. They can't seem to make up their minds what to offer. Has changed at least twice in past 4 months. Will not recommend if you are after consistent food.
"9 tables of 4 with only 2 people at the tables with people waiting for tables ! Very inefficient. Whoever is supposed to be managing this place is not maximising seating capacity at all, very poor mgt."
"They give wrong information to people by labelling sandwiches as “plant based” on their menu, the breads they serve the sandwich include eggs/dairy. Disappointing!"
The carrot walnut cake is a must try!
High quality baked goods with a very tasty done in menu for all points of the day. Health conscious along side guilty pleasures!� …
"Excellent place to have a small gathering of friends or just to enjoy a quiet lone time reading a book n enjoying their many different breads,  food options n yummy cakes along with their drink selections. …"
Came with my auntie and the service was great. I know the staff are all working very hard. Thank you!
"The slice is soooo small. It has been inconsistent in the cake slices, especially for pick up orders.
Disappointed."
"Food is great! Though the ambience not so much, tables tend to be not properly cleaned either. Points for improvement :)"
Nice cake
"Messy noisy, not even checking temperature of customers. Where’s the safety and customer service. Try at your own risk and frustration."
A quiet outlet that serve the neighborhood. Is a cosy outlet where you can chill and relax.
Bought a pandan cake - it looked soft and tasted great - would be even better if it had been a touch more pandan-y.
Have stopped patronising this outlet as nothing quite annoys me more than seeing rude and seemingly unhappy staff.  Have other better ways to spend my day and money.
Good for brunch considering the portion size. Worth a try once in a while.
Visited last week. Food not that bad. But overpriced i felt.
I ❤️ carrot cake!
Air con not working. Very stuffy. Staff did not open door to ventilate. Not the first time with such issue.
3 course dinner package available now.

Heavily understaffed. Waited 40 minutes for a simple sandwich

Pricey cafe but good."

It is a nice place to have a small gathering for a family.
"Got some fly, disappointed"
Nice selection of free breads to go with their tasty soups.

"Disappointed after visiting this Cedele branch. My main issue is the main course I ordered. The pancake was not well made and a miserable two slices of bacon. I ordered the curried pumpkin but probably not my palate. The only reason I gave a one star is the organic coffee and chamomile tea, which are similar to other outlets."
Totally different standard from other Cedele outlets I have been to.  The barista never bother to decorate the coffee served.  The coffee tasted different too - I asked for cappuccino & there was hardly any foam in the coffee. Tasted like …

When i got up to ask about the order, only then I was informed that an ingredient was unavailable and was told to choose other options. The fact that they did not inform me after 30 mins and that I had to check with them is unacceptable."

The food was so-so and baked beans were missing from the All Day Breakfast. There are even a sparrow flying around inside !
Gud place for healthy and veg friendly breakfast and snacks with tea or coffee. NOT quickest of service but worth good food
Counter staff a bit slow other then that one of the more quiet eatery/cafe within waterway point
Always love their ondeh cake. Also a good service in the cafe.
lousy coffee made. Ordered cappuccino what I received yucky coffee and milk .. no training given to the staff? When you charging $4.50 a cup?
Delicious Burgers with salad or fried sweet potato as side. Likes the mushrooms wrap as well.
Terribly average... not too worth the price. The everyday breakfast is hardly worth and hardly tasty.
Annoying guy Anthony serving at their counter. I wish there was an option to choose quarter star instead of one full star
I didn't like the food
Nice delicious food served here. Was pleasantly surprised by their eggs & avocado on toast. Thumbs up!

"Great healthy options to choose from, and prices are reasonable. We had roasted chicken sandwich and salmon & avocado sandwich. Found that the walnut bread was superb! Would return to try the full set with soup and coffee."
"Place has been renovated and menu has changed again, fewer vegan options but cafe is now more spacious and brighter with increased seating capacity. Prices have gone up quite a bit but the food is still good. Portions are decent. Service staff can be overwhelmed when crowd starts to form."
There's a shocking drop in the standard of desserts. My order (via deliveroo) of carrot cake slice and strawberry tart today was such a disappointment. The carrot cake was so much smaller - it's about 30% of the usual size of a cake slice I …
"Nice, quiet eatery with friendly staff.  We love the carrot cake here, though prices have gone up.   They also serve a variety of burgers for lunch."
We usually just get our bread from Cedele since it is within walking distance from where we live. The breads appear to be made more healthy and not sweet which are pluses for us. This time we had a late breakfast. The coffee was good …
"They have the best coffee in Singapore, and also the worst coffee in Singapore - it just depends which day you go. They are terribly inconsistent. For example, some days an iced latte means espresso pourer over ice and fresh milk (as it is …"
"Booked a cake in advance and went to collect it at the appointed day on 9 August 10.30am. Took half an hour just to pick up a cake! Service is terrible- staff took their own sweet time to look for it and put icing on it, ignoring the long queue of people just waiting to be served."
Food Delivery - was craving for a good heathy sandwich and ordered the Spinach Lentil patty and mushroom burger - it had to be something that I can’t put together on my own. Came with a burger bun (a little dry) all nicely wrapped up and still warm.
Great food and coffee!
just a really good spot for a quiet meal with friends. the ambience is really nice and this particular one on frankel avenue has great food. highly recommend the basil ppesto chicken sandwich thin
"Order one All in big breakfast from Grab, the portion is extremely small and the tomato didn’t cut and clean properly, surprising that a cafe don’t know how to serve tomato properly pay$20 for it feel very disappointed."
"Comfortable spacious cafe selling a variety of food, including all day breakfast and gourmet sandwiches. Parking can be tricky during the weekend."
"Beware their severe price hikes, not to mention they were already expensive to begin with. You get No value whatsoever here. Horrible coffee. Horrible service and all rude unbothered staff, especially Elise. Cold and dry attitudes and food. …"
Cosy and comfortable environment. Nice place to have afternoon tea and muffin. Suitable for Couples and small groups discussion.
"Nice quiet place, go there for breakfast usually. On one occasion I ordered a cake to be picked up from there. The shop's central kitchen did not deliver on time but the shop supervisor offered me my pick from the ones on display. Save me a return trip"
"While the food is good, the service is way below the other stores. The older lady behind the counter is extremely rude and speak in a patronizing manner. I believe her name is Susan. Also, please bring your own utensils as according to her they no longer provide any. What a way to surprise your customers."

"One of the worst Cedele branches. Staff are unprofessional, food portion is small and very average tasting, coffee is bad.
Only reason to visit is to get bread/cakes which are prepared in a central kitchen."
Having a rest here!
Called 69229716 to enquire on online ordering of cakes. Lady who picked up lacked basic courtesy and training.  Zero empathy and interest to entertain genuine enquiry. Kept referring me to go online and didn’t bother to listen. Such a pity …
"Enjoyed the food there, it was delicious and worth the price!"
"Writing this review for the friendly staff .. special mention to Mary. Always so patient ..
We all like their walnut bread."
"Visit on any day, the Mid-age Lady Staff has Cold Attitude toward specific group of people. She never replied to my Hello and said thanks to me. But thanks to the Caucasian customers ONLY."
"My favourite place for muffins. I have never been to this place but order online muffins, breads and cake loaf. Their not so sweet muffins are must try."
Below average coffee.  Not the coffee you'd expect from hipster cafes. The pastries and buns and breads in the store are the main attractions. Freshly baked. Great for take away.
"All day dinning cozy cafe. Nice place to have a set meal at their outdoor seating area. Bus stop nearby, parking space available but limited."
"Order one All in big breakfast from Grab, the portion is extremely small and the tomato didn’t cut and clean properly, pay$20 for it very disappointed."
Been here for years. Service is always slow.
Great place for a nice laid back weekend brunch! Good variety of food available as well. The outside seating provides great ambience! :)
The food here is amazing! Healthy and tastes great. Staff are friendly. Just a cozy little place.
"Will not return. Staff wasn’t friendly at all.
Ordered all day breakfast and they gave ridiculous little amount of greens."
Nice and cosy place. The salad and cakes were good!
"No wifi and cold atmosphere. Food was alright, bit pricey."
"Food is okay, atmosphere is rather bland"
Very poor service! Possibly the worst Cedele in Singapore

"We bought onde onde cake for a birthday celebration and a whole cake ,@ $48.00 was very good value . The sponge was light and fluffy and packed with gula melaka and fresh grated coconut. The fresh creal added a luxurious touch ."
"I like Cedele. I frequent the place for my breakfast, lunch and tea all the time. In cafes and restaurants service is important and I know it varies from place to place. It makes or breaks an establishment. Unfortunately the lady behind this counter may break it. Hope the management will help with their  attitude."
Came here a couple of times.. But it always felt like I owed the staff and had to beg to be served. …
"Came here to get a coffee. Ordered a cappuccino with soy which was $6.50 and the drink was such a disappointment. it had a strange after taste and could not taste the soy milk at all. Do not reccommend getting the coffee here. Similar to other reviews, the staff's attitude was not the best, very emotionless and curt."

Good food but less than helpful staff unfortunately. Only half my order was delivered via Grab as they forgot to put it in the bag before handing over to the delivery driver.
"Good bread and average coffee. Staff indifferent to the point of rudeness. It's that Singapore thing where they believe if they are unsmiling and uncommunicative, this somehow translates to efficiency. It doesn't - it's just a lack of customer service skills. Bread is just about worth it though..."
"Usually not comment this kind of comment chain stores. I do appreciate the food and meal, and visit not less 3 times a week, but still have to say the service definitely could be better and improved. Believe that clients don't mind if the staffs wear smile and are more patient."
"Visited last night! I give props to the staff Jayne and Yu Xuan - while not especially cheery, they were both patient and pleasant enough which in Singapore is not to be taken for granted. The place was real empty on a Tuesday night, with …"
Staff is not very friendly although there wasn't much crowd. It would be good if Cedele encourages patrons to bring their own mugs/tumblers.
Great customer service.  We bought the promotional coffee card.. $24 for 24 cups of black coffee or tea.  Upgrade to flat white just costs $1.  Expiration is end of Oct 2021.  Flat white is excellent and the lemon grass tea is also very good.

It was a major mistake coming to this cafe. I hate to leave a bad review but the coffee was incredibly bad and the unenthusiastic lady behind the counter doesn't improve the situation. I ordered a Cappuccino and it had close to zero …
"How can service staff be so untrained?  I love the cakes by Cedele but iced coffee here is just taste like water. Staff just do their work, no smiles, no emotions and even no eye contact when taking orders. We also experienced days when staff simply ignore us."

"Love the lunch set menus. Salad and the ciabatta bread are great too. Lots of vegetarian options, healthy too! Only it can get a bit crowded sometimes but worth the wait. I wish they would open till late in the night as a lot of the restaurants in Little India are open till 12 midnight. Otherwise nothing to complain about."
"I love the unique organic selection of tea, salad and sandwiches that only cedele has."
"Good customer service, clean premises!
Their bread is fresh and there is a good flow of customers to ensure that what is made is sold quickly... I look at that to get peace of mind that I will not be given items that have been sitting on the shelf for a long time."
I tried their salad and found that some vegetable went bad.. I was able to smell something sour and also the taste was gone. It could cause serious food poisoning. Luckily I threw them away to rubbish. …
"I bought 6 cupcakes takeaway, very tasty and moist, cashier very polite"
"Cedele, yes! I'm so happy that I live nearby. This is the default selection when I'm looking for something healthy, light and easy to eat. Thanks for always being there when I'm lazy to make my own food. � …"
The Cedele at City square is a decent cosy place. Food is good. There are good varieties in their cakes and pasteries selection but I feel their new selection (cakes) pieces are very small cuts compared to their old ones like the carrot and red velvet cakes. It's not worth the money we pay for the slices. $8.50 per piece.
"The staffs here are very bad. Tried to order cheesecake and they have Yuzu and Caramel, but the label was folded made me cannot see full label. The staffs never cared and gave attitude. They shall make sure the full label can be viewed by …"

The chicken avocado on walnut bap was quite tasty. Had an oat latte with hazelnut which i enjoyed too.

"Today, I had invited a friend for lunch and was keen to also show Cedele as a partner of Krispay. It is a feature of Krispay to get Krisflyer points even if we pay using the credit cards (as stated in the app). The manager says no. The app …"
"Good range of veggie food.
Yuzu cheesecake is good but small portion.
Chai latte was horrendous... It was just a tea bag and steamed milk"
The cake selections are good. They have a number of unique flavours and some they customised for festivities such as Mother's day or father's day. Do try the Gula Melaka Pandan cake when there.
Decent sitting areas... Disinfected after every visit.
"I love the food but not the staff. Not friendly at all.. Patronise twice, smile to them and speak to them nicely still.. Well I guess Singapore every where is the same.."
"Can get a bit busy at times but staff are lovely. Great service, could do with four full time staff members instead of the usual three. Excellent value for money and good quality fare."
"Not a great place. Seating and ambiance pretty bad, had an iced chocolate, it was 5.50, a huge rip off. Only good thing were the staff."
It is an open concept bakery. there is small seating tabels. they serve sandwichs and cakes. Service is nice. It is self service.
"Western (espresso machine) coffee was extremely bad, cake ok.  Regretted not getting a tastier kopitiam coffee at a third the price..."
I always go there as a last resort for non foodcourt/fatty meals. However the toppings are always sub-standard quality and the bread stale.
"Food was not great and portions were small for the price. Maybe it was just today, but standards were not met."
Quality and tasty food... Vegan options.. Nice place. Prices are higher... But you get quality instead � …
"Very good bread options. Onion olive coriander , linseed multigrain and garlic focaccia are amazing."
"Awful service, totally disorganized staff. Half the menu unavailable. I love Cedele but I'll never visit this branch again."
Had a quick coffee break. Coffee was good it was freshly brewed. Cool environment.
Pretty bad service and food. For a place that is supposed to be known for breads it was hard and stale.
"Love their beetroot avacado sandwich.
Their roasted tomato capsicum soup is delicious!"
Regular mall type pastry shop. Food quality okay since products are pricey... service staff doesn't interact to introduce products...
"Cedele always has very good carrot walnut cakes, yummy!"
"Nice place to chill, good for tea time breaks."
"Good food at a reasonable price, efficient staff. The cakes are awesome."
Food is good and vegetarian options are available. Service standards can be improved.
Long black coffee dilute. Carrot cake is good!
Not really worth the money but not the worse soup I have taste
If you're looking for bad service. This is the place to be. If you're looking to pay for tasteless drinks. You're in the right branch.
Great selection of cakes. Nice ambience
Lots of seating available.
Cake and tea promo is a value for money. Cake slices are huge.
Kind of expensive but very nice! I like their nut milk selection and soups
Service at counter not good. Serving staff not attentive to customers. Seatind arrangement like canteen style
Good food but very small portions.
Nice cosy place to chill and have a cuppa tea or coffee.
Pretty cool place and plenty of seats to sit
Order wild mushrooms soup. Nice view
The menu look very miserable.
"I would say, decent food and service"
Coffee is quite good. Good selection of cakes..
"Decent coffee ...always busy, nice pastries"
Good eggs and bacon for breakfast. A little on the expensive side for what is.
Best places to eat healthy sandwiches and salads
they served quite decent breakfast
"One to avoid. Undrinkable espresso, had to take it back."
They have some really good and healthy options.
Quality of food has really deteriorated.
Always the best place for soups and sandwiches
Nice place for.coffee and chill
Canteen cup 👎� …
Not cheap... Feel thirsty after food.
Limited selection compared to other outlets

Pre ordered a cake for a birthday on Grab. It never arrived and no one from the outlet was contactable
"Not only the staff are always very friendly at this branch. I was very impressed with the way my loaf was cut yesterday, it was perfectly cut without de-shaping even though it's hollow on the inside."
"Despite being empty, the service was poor. Served our food without utensils and rushed us to make an order."

"Worst Cedele out of all the Cedele outlets, no good sandwiches or wraps, horrible service"
"Cold fries, tasteless food and mouldy salads served....never coming back here again, period"
Its different but not entirely satisfying..... N slightly pricey for an average meal.... Can be improved upon!!
Average food and service experience
They ran out of lemons with a cold storage in the same building that's not a good reason not to be able to serve ice lemon tea.
"Food is nice
Staff attitude need to improve especially the chinese girl on cashier counter"
This is a great place for meeting. Good consistent good and coffee. Many locations.

Good quality food. Cute waitress. Good place to chill
"Look at how beautiful this tiramisu is. My God, can I save it in my display cupboard. Slurpppp..."
Pricey for simple set lunch of $28. Nice bread.
Great bakery chain in Singapore. Also has some vegan breads
Service level has dropped a lot since my last visit.
This is different from the normal cede了. They serve different menu. Not very nice.
Nice food..
Woefully understaffed - but otherwise the hardware's in place for a potentially better dining experience.
Terrible on Sun. Only 2 staffs. 1 making coffee the other doing the rest...
"Terrible service. Need to ask. At least couple times for almost everything. From the manager to service staffs, no one seem to care."
Food is good. Service needs to be improved
The service always makes me grumpy but i reluctantly come back for the soups
It seems like they've both downsized and downclassed after the renovation
As usual they forgot to make one out of three dishes ordered.
Nice environment and good place for coffee
"Friendly staff, okay pasta, great soup!"
Great food great people and value for money!

a really great Cedele outlet! the shop is warm and the staff was really friendly and welcoming :)! their strawberry tarts are one of my all time faves!
"Nice little shop with friendly staff. Sells relatively healthy sandwiches, soups and pastries. Prices are quite steep though. Wild mushroom soup is not bad. Limited seating available"
"Expect nonchalant service, or non responsive staff.
Very poor etiquette, zero service standards"
This branch is so so. I love Cedele but unfortunately staff is not train properly how to deal with customers. Food assembly was also very poor and little. Disappointed a bit after buying from them for years( my wraps were half empty). If i want to eat empty wraps i can get prata for 2$.

"This is the first review I'm doing because this outlet sucks. I ordered the packaged sandwich, waiting for my free soup. The staff said..wanted free soup to colleague in a demeaning way, n proceeded to bill me without the soup...like waiting for me to request for it. No thank u n I regret signing up for Ur membership"
"They should have proper training to the staff on how to greet customers. The male cashier greeted all the women customers as darling. Food is good, but for that, there's tons of other cedele branches I'll visit instead."

"The 2 scones for my child were burnt after warming by the staff and they still served them to me. Very dishonest, I had to reason with them and pointed to the burnt scones in order to get teh staff to change new ones for me.

Love their curry pumpkin soup!

Not bad. Dinner rolls provided for the soup. Standard Starbucks-ish prices
Reasonable portions...but no salad bar at this outlet
Great place for healthy food options
Great place for meeting friends over coffee and cake
"Nice cafe, lots of types of cakes are available"
Avoid bacon egg sandwich since it’s hard as rock and way too salty.
Cedele always excellent selection and value
Nice food but a bit expensive
Cedele ia always good so far.
Walnut cake is delish
Wonderful experience especially a lazy afternoon
Good coffee and cake
Very costly
Yummy food.
Cosy little outlet that serves decent meals and coffee. The sandwiches are well prepared and ingredients are very fresh. Overall a nice place for a quick bite.
"Food here is actually quite good & portion sizes are reasonable. Like many F&B outlets here, they are short handed too. Customers will need to exercise some patience to get the attention of the service staff. …"

Can I hear my grandmother telling me about the privations of war!) but even hungry, I just can’t take the buns. They just were so stale."

"Good place for a rest. Nice tea and desserts available. Service was great too. However, it is not a place for dining imo, there wasnt much to chose from in the menu for mains. Prices are high which was expected considering the location."
I enjoyed my fish and salsa but not the accompanying quinoa which was undercooked. The beef burger my son had was huge and very tasty. Service was nice and just right.

Staff was friendly and food came rather quickly"

I was standing at the entrance to wait to be pick up but despite servants saw me, they ignore totally. But that’s okay.. I helped myself for my own seats. THEN I GOT STARED DEEP BY A YOUNG CHINESE GIRL SERVANT."

Food selection as well as quality was good (4/5).

"One of the best high tea sets as compared to other cafes, good selection of both savoury and sweet. Friendly staff and peaceful ambience."
"Vietnamese waitress said there were no tables and waiting time was 30mins. We immediately flag out the empty table and she reluctantly showed us to the table. Service was bad, dirty tables, and long waiting time."
Nice ambience with spacious seating arrangement. Service was great too. Food was served hot and substantial portion.

Personal experience was great. My server Desmond was really helpful. Great suggestions and was really attentive to detail down to the timing of serving your drink with your main dish. It was this serving attitude that made our experience really pleasant and would really encourage myself to return more often.

The service is great and the desserts are tasty!

"Staffing seems to be adequate but often times than not, diners had to expend extra effort in getting service"
"V nice steak n barramundi,  pasta is gd too"
Food ok. Service is getting worse. Male manager not attentive n pull a long face to customers.

Well thanks for not picking up."
Good food
Poor service (had to request for condiments several times before finally getting it + was overcharged) and food quality. Will not recommend
Cakes are good but flat white sub standard. The soup of the day tasted like it came out of a can.
Terrible. They ran out of sausages and told me I can pay for extra to replace it with something. Baffling.
"Poor service, waiter was disinterested couldn't even speak properly. Pie was microwaved and still cold in center, served without a knife."
Staff just ignores you at the entrance if the restaurant is almost full. So we just left.

Whole restaurant had only 2 staff and one of them was a schooling kid who has no …"
"They serve very nice cakes, coffee and tea."
Nice place to have high tea
"Restaurant half empty, and still waited over 45 minutes for food.
Nonchalant service. This restaurant does not deserve to be in business."
there is no board that says from 530 to 630 pm there is no service. I was waiting tin the Q here for a while. So don't go there at 530 pm.
The food is really good as usual though I would say it's on the pricey end. Service is professional rather than friendly.
"Terrible, rude service. Much better places to stop for a coffee or tea in the mall. Avoid."
"Their manager Aloysius is very helpful and friendly, he recommend food to us very patiently."

There's a generous amount of avocado and. A bit hard to eat - falls apart easily. Not my favourite cedele outlet. Don't be fooled by ""burger"". This is very healthy-fied."
So far it has become one of my lunching place as my workplace does not have much salad choices.

The coffee is atrocious. Diluted and not worth the purchase. Don’t waste your time buying coffee here
Nice place to have coffee in a garden environment. Cedele is a restaurant with the salad base with 4 toppings is $8.80 with a nice Ceasar dressing or any other dressings.
"We come here for quick birthday cake fixes, and to get cakes and soups as and when necessary. It has reached a point where people in my team will say ""Cedele cake like not sincere"", but it's still the best option amongst what you can get around MBC and ARC area."
Nice cosy coffee shop with a ngood selection of sandwiches and cakes. Slightly limited in seating.
"Healthier choice around the business park. Mix and match salad, sandwich, cake and cofffee."
Plenty of seats inside.
Love their breakfast set here. Their speed of service is great too

Service was on the slower side though there wasn’t much crowd during lunch. Protein bowl was pretty tasty. Chicken and the falafels were good. More salad dressing would be better.
Food taste not bad..if you come at weekend will queue to take a seat.. service oke
I like carrot cakes the most among the rest. Sandwiches are also good. Though it is a bit expensive.
Very bad customer service.. Staffs are so rude especially the one in the coffee counter.. she spolied our day with her attitude when we asked for sugar pockets. …
Very rude staff. Charged extra amount for the food and unruly behaviour.
"Food and service are, per Cedele standard, very good. But probably due to the busyness of the lunch time crunch, many tables were not cleared. Maybe they should consider putting up a sign to ask patrons to help clear their own used crockery and cutlery."
Today had a very bad experience and staffs are very rude especially coffee making staff.Really very bad service.
"being a cedele member, it's my go-to place. like the salmon sandwich thin and the vegan burger options. salad is meh. for cakes: red velvet, carrot walnut and matcha chocolate cake. for cupcakes: peanut butter and pandan cupcakes . their apple and pear crumbles are great too. good place for a dessert lover like myself."
Service is super horrible. Extremely rude people. They are surely spoiling brand of Cedele with their God awful and extremely  rude and unprofessional service. Go anywhere else
Food doesn’t taste well
Good enough. Not great.
"bad service, the staff was rude too."
Very disappointed with this branch. Ordered some breakfast treats via Deliveroo. The cake came melted. The 2 blueberry crumble muffins are completely different - 1 is burnt as well.
"Disappointed. Had to say our order 3 times to be understood. The order was the roasted cauliflower soup. When asking the staff of my bread could be toasted, the reply: ‘no we don’t toast the free bread’. How is the soup with bread free at just under 10dollars? Shocking."

Lady at the counter is very rude each time. They do not have some basic ingredients as avocado at 11:30.
I came once hoping for a peaceful experience and had noisy staff members shouting at each other and playing music on their phone (despite COVID rules about music in eateries). I came back a second time for another chance but had the same …
"When dining in, tap water is not provided. Instead, the establishment pushes the purchase of bottled water, despite a sign inviting patrons to ”reduce plastic waste” by not using straws, also a single-use plastic product."
The staff who prepared the salads is careless and missed out on the protein in one of our takeaway salads. How are they expecting us to check through all the orders? Please be more careful next time.
"Nice services, nice Mocha and Gula Malaka Sponge Cake. � …"
"The staff will make sure you are frustrated by their arrogance and sloppy service. Every time you order something, they will either not have some ingredient or miss something in your order or forget to tell you something right at the beginning. Dont expect to get the receipt unless you insist. Totally avoidable."
Always run out of main dish even at 1pm
"Coffee taste so good. A great place to just sit, sip a cup of coffee and have some random conversation with a friend.. no wifi just a friend to talk to is enough! :)"
"Good selection, quick and good service.
They have mince pies and other snacks for the Christmas period."
Rude staff

Loved the rye sourdough and cranberry scones. The rye sourdough is hard to get hold of and sold out very quickly. Nice place for dining in with a wide selection of salad and sandwiches.

"Enjoyed my vegan salad bowl. $11.90 for a medium-sized bowl that comes with 2 choices of base (greens/cauliflower rice/quinoa) + 2 servings of protein +4 toppings. Falafel is the only protein option. Generous portions and very filling. With soup, it costs $15. Overall, pleased with taste and portion."
"This breakfast was a small one which cost 8.50. Enjoyed the fresh croissant, scrambled eggs n 2 pieces Of rocket leaves. Bacon was over cooked. Very spacious but empty at 0830 (I wonder why?). Staff looked like they did not want to be …"
The ondeh ondeh cake was pretty good. Have eaten at several Cedele branches over the years & so far I have had positive experiences. I do miss the pizza scones that they used to make.
Food and sandwiches are pretty decent in taste and quality. But things are a little overpriced considering the small portion sizes. $10.8 for a breakfast bagel deluxe seems to be on the pricey side.
"Their standard drop on the gourmet thins were not crispy as many years ago that I have ate. The skinny flat white is moderately good, coffee taste was still alright."
"The cakes are really wholesome and good.
The chocolate cake is light letting the chocolate be the star of the show.
Not sinfully sweet or unctuous , with the tinge of bitterness of dark chocolate. …"
"Really like the Ondeh Ondeh cake! Not too sweet and very well made with each slice melting in your mouth, asking for a second slice ! Enjoy."

Love the food. Bread is consistently good quality. They also offer salads which is a healthy option for lunch. Comes with soup and free flow bread. Try go go at non peak hours as it can get busy with long waits.
Nice atmosphere and fairly friendly staff. Really lovely all day breakfast which is well balanced and bit heavy meal. Good start to a big day.
So grateful to the handsome staff who reminds me that i left my phone on the cashier counter. Thank u and sorry i did not get ur name. Cedele sell wonderful and delicious cakes.
High quality and freshness of bread loaf. They serve eggless and sugarless and perfect for people and young kids with special dietary options.

"Visited >30 min before closing for dessert, and the staff said they only do takeaways lol"
My experience with the service staff at the counter was so so only. Worse still there was a quite sizeable pigeon walking around.
My smoked turkey sandwich was burnt on the bap. Mushroom soup was diluted.
"Service so-so, staff looks overworked and tired but prices has gone up! Their cakes used to be $6+ now it's $8+ and the servings has shrunk. Inflation cuts both ways now."

I was in the queue and the server was chit chatting to the customer before me instead of serving her. I waited for a few minutes and then asked if someone else can serve me. The server said she’s the only person serving customers. She then …
Their salads are delicious and fresh. But better for takeaways rather than dine in as their staff prioritise customers who do takeaways. Table sittings are limited.

Just terrible. Service staff completely ignores customers while we are waiting in line. They have no interest to take your order and are just doing their own work. The person before me gave up and walked out. I decided to do the same.

Service is so so. Ordered a “All day breakfast” this morning. But didn’t enjoy the meal. There were too much of MSG in the food. The 2 pieces of bacon strips were extremely salty. My tongue was biting through out the rest of the day. The mushrooms tasted “rancid”-like. Pandan butter cake was excessively sweet. � …
Love this place. The beetroot burger is awesome. You get your choice of bread to have it on. The soups also come with as much bread as you can eat. Lunch time meal deals (sandwich and soup) are really good value. The mushroom soup in particular is amazing.
Food is good but service is lacking. I came in for brunch and had to wait 20 mins just to get some toasts and scramble eggs.

Food so so. And surprisingly no WiFi in this day and age. Can't even work while having a latte.
"Usual order is the DIY Salad, portions seems to be getting slightly smaller but still a wholesome meal on it's own. Of the salad alone is insufficient, add a soup and have free flow bread on the side."
I suppose the opening hrs is 7:30am and yet its almost 8 and the bakery is still not open. Staff can see people are waiting for the opening but they still taking their own sweet time to open. Whats the use of dispalying the operating hrs when its not even followed. 😡😡� …
"All the auntie staff here very rude . Bad service .I Order egg ben but the bacon over cook ,no  Hollandaise sauce also. Never come back again"
"Half expecting their quality of service to improve after they renovated, but nope. Cakes are good, but don't bother with their breakfast menu."
Reasonable serving of salads and one of the staff by the name of vidyya very professional and polite. To viddya thank you for the great service.

"Elderly auntie staff was so rude, did not even know what cake they sold, was not helpful and complained too much."
A little pricey but food is absolutely delicious! Decent and friendly staff too.
Nothing fantastic about service. Much could be done to improve it.  $7.50 chocolate cake was mind blowing. 2 stars for service.
"Items were pricey, staff were okay but you have to call out to them for them to pay attention to you."
Free flow of freshly baked assorted bread and olive oil. But the kitchen preparation is sometimes quite slow.
"I love the food but service is awful. They don’t track orders properly. If you’re hungry, you will need to wait."
"They are selling eggless ice cream in containers. Is good, especially like vanilla and strawberry flavors"

Cozy place with a good selection of freshly made wholemeal breads. Add a large cup of coffee. Yummi!
I always loved their gourmet sandwiches but they have reduced the size same price
Good coffee and cake but dirty tables and non of staff interested to clear table. 5 staff behind counter rather chat than clear tables.
"So different between AD And reality
Not recommend"
"Taked away a sandwich today, but I pull a strand of long hair out of my mouth halfway through eating it. Horrible."
Cedele is located right at the entrance & exit of Novena Square. Spaces and staff is very friendly ◡̈
Awesome bakery with good options for light meal or morning brunch.  But can be crowded in afternoon.
Basil pesto chicken wrap is delicious
I usually only get the soup. It's good and it's nice that you can take as much bread as you want.
Nice and quiet place to take a break. Staff are friendly too.
"Great salads, soup and coffee. Nonetheless staffs are not the friendliest."
"I am a fan of Cedele in general, but the service at this outlet seems especially poor - with nonchalant or unhelpful staff."
Great place to catch up and chat with friends. Loved the cappuccino :) service a little slow but very friendly service staff.
Just tried vegetarian burgers here(all of them) sooo untasted. Good bakery though.
"Standards were so so. Place was extremely packed during lunch hour.  The food was average, sandwiches were OK."
They serve early and breakfast meal is good.
Favourite cafe I go to. Delicious cakes.

Had a very bad experience Cerele Novena Square.
Cedele has always been known for their quality food.
Disappointing coffee
"Healthy eating. Bread, soups, salads. Tea & juices. Great place to eat healthy"
Consistent good quality bakes over the years.
"Nice cakes, good value on coffee + single slice cake deal."
Great bagels.
The new plant based sandwich quinoa tofu pumpkin is delicious!
My favourite chain for a flat white and carrot walnut cake.
Good food pathetic service. Racing towards extinction.
Good service and food. I like their flat white!
Love their potato salad and grain/green bowls.
Very busy with great bread on offer. Clean food
"A bit busy at peak hours, may need to wait for a while to order and pay."
Panckes are crazy awesome. Great place for brunch.
"Can get crowded during peak hours, otherwise food is ok."
Love the salads. Service to be improved though
More improvement needed on house keeping. Might be short handed. Tables not well cleared.
Dining area is too close to each other.
Delicious sandwiches at below $10
It is a good option for quick and healthy lunch.
Very very slow service and the kids attending are always talking and playing around.
Good wholesome food in a good location
Best cakes and ice cream I have eaten
My favourite when it comes to healthy bread variety
This place serves delicious cakes and beverages.
Great place for your healthy mid day teabreak.
Nice carrot cake and coffee :)

Nice place to spend some time. Love cupcakes and coffe here. Great place . Staff is gud
Probably my last sandwich there .. they have shrunk their sandwiches for pygmies
One of my top places for sandwich and espresso.
Of all the cedele outlets I went to. This is the worst. The food quality is not up to standard. I order the same pesto chicken wrap and it was so dry that for the most part of it I just leave it uneaten. …
Good spot for a quick fix lunch. A no fuss menu with plenty of options and fast turn around. Sandwiches all made on the spot and to order. Plenty of vegetarian options available
"Worst and rude service ever. My friend had an issue on their service, so she wrote to Cedele through their webpage. Its been more than a month and no response till date..now that's called ""pathetic customer service""!!!"
Changing sauce from mayonnaise to mustard costs $1.50. Daylight robbery. Lady operator is unfriendly.
"The WORST customer service I have experienced in a long while. Too long to explain here, but just infuriating. There are many other options nearby - I highly suggest you choose one of those."
Love the soup options in Cedele.  Worth the money
Nice pull pork sandwich

"Nice staff so 2 stars. Other than that, not worth it. I'm a big fan of Cedele but the location at paragon is now so downsized and meager on ingredients that UT doesn't warrant the price. Novena still the best."
Very rude service staff. I am a regular customer. The usual lady staff is pleasant. But there was a male service staff today and he was very rude. Never had such an unpleasant experience before. I am shocked by his poor attitude. He tore up the qr code sticker that was right in front of me and threw it onto the ground.
"Service is extremely poor, was asking for sugar the staff name Susan told us to look for ourself. Even accuse us saying we were drinking drink from other stall, which we don’t even open up the drink cover at all. Kindly avoid the CEDELE BAKERY CAFE!

Nice turmeric golden milk drink � …
"1st visit ★★★★★
A bit pricey, but the taste was really nice. Not only the ingredients inside, but also the bread!!! …"
Chai latte was not so good. Quite spicy and relatively diluted.
"Outlet is now situated in B1 of Paragon shopping center. Sits approximately 18 pax. Serves limited hot food (soup), sandwiches, and cakes. Cedele is more well known for their sandwiches in the past. Went to try their cakes in Dec20 and regret to say that all tasted overly sweet. Service crews were friendly, serve time was fast."
stall opened later than official opening time. Very rude staff. No management present to handle them. What a disappointment compared to other toss and turn stalls
Drinks are watered down to the max. Tastes like my wife and I are drinking flavored iced water (we ordered red roibos tea and matcha latte) .....
I had the Tropikale and loved it. My husband had the Sprinting Buddha - he wasn’t crazy about the falafel which was rather soft. Falafels should be crispy on the outside.
"Very unfriendly staff and slow service, just avoid."
Not the usual staff preparing my sandwich today; portion too small comparing to previous visits.
Great salads  lots of selections - love eating heathy!
Often overlooked as it's tucked away at the back of L1 in Paragon. Quiet place for lunch unlike most of Orchard Road.
The staff is not friendly.

"I received my Mother’s Day cake from my kids as the pic show. Carrot cake Used to be our favorite but this order I am too disappointed. Never mind the cake arrive not in good shape, but the totally lack of sweetness and the stale of the nuts throws me off. I hope Cedele will start analyst the recipe."

The queue system can be better managed."

Bad service. Have to fight for tables and 3 customers cut us just to get the tables.

I do feel the quality of Cedele has dropped drastically over the past few years but the quality at this outlet seemed to be worse than other outlets."
Having their mushroom soup almost every week once. It's nvr consistent.  Today probably its by far the worst  very watery n tasteless. Not sure if I shld b happy for health. But it did satisfy my taste buds. I do love their bread choices still. And the front counter staff are always looking moody.

Amazing taste. thanks a lot

"I tried the chocolate truffle cake, which was recommended from a website I looked at for top bakeries. It was delicious! It had a rich, chocolatey flavor and the very small bottom layer is shortbread, which was a nice touch. This is the only thing I tried, but I would recommend!"

Great disappointment from cedele. Wasted $19 on the Beef ball bolognese. Sourish and beef had a strange texture. Not fresh.

"Food is ok, but was unhappy with service today. There's a sign ""Please wait to be seated"", which I queued behind it for more than 5mins, & your staff chose to serve the pair who ""waited inside first"". I'm pretty sure they came after me,& walked straight in. I left immediately, and certainly not going back again."
"Surprisingly good burger albeit slightly pricey in a cafe which is more known for its bread and salads. While surprising, note that the patty is still a little dry, and the caramelized onions were too sweet and hence a bit out of place. Still not a bad option to have as a fallback however."
"Ideal place to dine on a weekday, a catch up with friends and loved ones. Healthy food options and beverages available."
Stayed here for tea time and tried their Eggless chocolate truffle cake. I was amazed by how delicious and creamy this cake is. I believe its a no-bake cake and the chocolate just melts in your mouth.

Amazing chocolate truffle cake
Cedele food and coffee never disappoints.. the pasta was flavourful and healthy with tempeh served on top.. yummy!
Terrible service. Variety of salad toppings and quality are pathetic to say the least. No bread counter at this outlet as well. Staff are unfriendly. Won’t pay this price for veggies again.
Am here at Cedele Raffles City.  Noisy crowd and full house but floor staff of 3 led by Sara are doing a great job of systematically serving and clearing tables. Well done!
Please train your new staff properly. $8.50 for a sandwich and she gave me a PATHETIC amount of chicken.

My go-to after lunch spot when I’m in the busy CBD area.
Large and clean outlet near the entrance of republic plaza. Friendly staff. Seats are comfortable too.
Food is good. Service is dreadfully slow. You can stand in line for a very very long time
I have always been a fan of cedele so I decide to try the new outlet at republic plaza. However the quality is below expectation. The green tea soba is way too salty. I practically left the all of them untouched. I am very disappointed with the quality of food served at this outlet.
"A fan of Cedele. I came here to celebrate birthday with my friend. The coffee was great as usual. However, the caramel sea salt tiramisu cake was not upto the mark. It was loaded with sugar unlike other Cedele cakes. I'm disappointed :("
Macaroons taste good. Staff appear snobbish and are unfriendly

Back again for a coffee break after lunching at nearby green dot. Another place recommended for their carrot cake. Ordering took quite a while as it was lunch hour. They served really good cakes.

"Big fan for whole-wheat their sourdough .

The strawberry tart and matcha chocolate cake are my recommended to eat. It seems they are short handed. A little messy at the counter.

The eggless chocolate cake is yummy! We had the last slide. Fudge cake taste close to dark choc
Cakes here are good however not the cheapest. Red velvet is my all time favourite.
"Very cozy place. Cake was on the more expensive side but was amazing. Recommends the carrot cake with walnut! Most cake have cheese cream in them, so if you're a cheese lover, this is a place for you."
Coffee is nice.  Ordered 2 milkshakes for kids. Bad Taste like milk with low end chocolate syrup. Pretty low standard milkshake for $8. They must remove milkshake menu or improve quality.

This is the worst Cedele ever! Drastically different quality standards compared to other Cedele outlets. The way the actual dish looks is nothing like what is pictured in the menu. Have given it a couple of tries hoping that it was a …
always a feast here. crowded brunch time especially after sunday church services
Good food selections and cozy ambiance. However they should have a better SOP for the service staff. Was quite confused where the line starts because the customer for the ordering on site food / coffee is mixed with the customer collecting …
"Terrible grab food experience. Food that came was a far cry from the pictures and descriptions shown on the grab platform. Ordered grilled chicken with avocado served with tomato salsa, grilled zucchini and quinoa but what came instead was plain brown rice, some tough pieces of chicken and some unappetising tomatoes and lettuces."
Nice food. Variety of selection. Eat clean. Crowded as expected
"Average quality coffee and tea, and slightly above average cakes. Place is not as conducive for catch ups as compared Starbucks nearby. Save your money for something of better value and atmosphere."
"Always love the baked goods in Cedele! Enjoyed brunches there too on weekends! Good service, quality food and reasonable pricing!"
Nice little bakery cafe. Can get busy around lunch.
"Unpleasant dirty environment with uncleared plates and dishes around. I visited this outlet on 25 Feb 17:40hrs; I ordered my drink and food and asked the staff to clear dirty dishes on table for me, he replied yes without looking at me …"
Cedele is always a nice place to dine in. There is indoor and outdoor. Though it is more cramped than other outlets and there is an echo which I feel others can hear your conversations.
My 1st time at this place...nice and cosy venue to catch up with friends on a hot afternoon at 3.30 pm. My sister chose this venue to  meet and 3 of us (with my sister-in-law) had an hour plus of discussion. …
Best carrot walnut cake. Also adore the suji almond cake. It’s very lightly sweet with a hint of rose. Lots of veg and vegan options.
Not impressed with the burger. It was more of a sandwich and the amount of avacado provided was v little and the chicken was hard. I will not recommend this particular dish. I believe anyone could have made a better burger/ sandwich. What was nice was that you can help yourself to some slices of bread to dip in olive oil
Am appalled by the service or lack of it at Star Vista. Ordered food and drinks at 334pm. Staff only realised food wasn’t prepared when I enquired abt it at 406pm. Prawn salad served at 415pm. But our grilled chicken was served to another …
Lovely place to come on a Saturday morning. Great coffee and delicious cakes
"Healthy and yummy food, nice and fun menu. Gripe is that the burgers are really overpriced. Just a bit more substantial than a sandwich and with a few leaves on the side, but twice the price."
A nice place with various healthy food to choose from. Unfortunately limited numbernof seats available inside the store. However there more seats outside the store. It is near the road path to the car park so at peak hour may experience …
Have those chocolate cravings? This is a place to eat eggless (dark) chocolate Truffle cake. Its definitely what chocolate should be rich creamy yet light and not too sweet. Its the best eggless pastry I have had in Singapore. For the …
Pretty standard. Cakes extremely sweet
"I usually come for cakes and coffee. Cakes are generally awesome, and the ang moh carrot cake won't disappoint you (if i am not wrong the carrot cake is vegan too). …"
Its a tiny place with limited sittings. Took the mango lassi- yogurt drink(nice & not the over sweet type) with a cranberry scone. I would prefer the scone to be more biscuit like texture. Used to have flourless cake. Hope it'll return.
Healthy café with several chains across Singapore. The food is pretty good across the board – some favorites are the grain bowls and soup with bread. Pastas are ok as well though a bit too saucy. …
Pretty good coffee and the walnut carrot cake is awesome!
"2021-05: Always like Cedele, maybe not as pretty as some other bakeries selection, but they have the taste right, especially their cakes....and thats more important for me."
"The food is ok but the staff needs some kind of basic training before they should be allowed to talk to customers. The person who brought our order asked if we ordered what she brought, then insisted that we answer her, as though she didn't know and didn't believe us. Whut..."
I love Cedele but this outlet always seem to have problems with service and maintaining a certain level of consistency for their food and coffee. The chain really need to invest in smarter ways of managing orders as long queues is a trademark of this outlet.
All are nice..felt the service could be better
Watery and tasteless pasta Alfredo combined with rude and poor counter service would have called for a 1 star rating. Only saving grace was the coffee which was served with no less than a clanging of the saucer on the tray. This is specific only to Star Vista branch. Have no issues at my usual branch.
Poor customer service. Because we sit outside table and  the stuff don’t even bother us and we have to take water ourself .  The presentation of food is not good and they even missed our order .
"I always like Cedele's food, especially the vegetarian thin bread with melted cheese.  But I am quite disappointed with the one at Star Vista, the cheese is so little I hardly tasted it. Therefore I asked them for some butter, and they want …"
Great place for healthy food with veg options
good location with nice big glass windows. The salads that are served at some cedeles are not served here as it is a smaller outlet
"Healthy but tasty good food. Always reliable. Except that $18 salad is too little, I'm already hungry in 2 hours, and I'm not even a big eater. � …"
"Not enough indoor seating. Outdoor seating is too warm.
3stars, 1 more star is for their Sea salt caramel cheesecake. So yum!"
"Food is good, but the service is atrocious. Saw staff sitting and taking up space during their break when customers were looking for places to sit. Also, way too few staff on site to manage the crowd."
"Cakes and drinks were a bit plain - not recommended for those with strong taste buds.
Staff were alright, at times friendly but other times dismissive."
"Must try their cake! Always one of the chooses in my cake list.
Grilled Seabass is very nice. Taste like tikka masala. Fish is fresh.
Egg Benedict, salmon with thick toast, is cold. Very disappointed. Taste weird and awful."
"Good choice of desserts and coffee. However, be prepared to wait a long time to pay for your order during busier periods due to the excruciatingly slow service/ lack of staff."
Had many visits before but surprisingly food is not what i have been had today. Soup is cold and bread is utterly dry. and i am seeing some ants on my table. Sorry but i dont think i would come anymore
"Only bakery stuff were nice. Food was reallyyyyyyy awful. Tumeric prawn pasta....ughhhhh. Found a piece of paper in the dark chocolate cake. Sent in feedback, not a single apology or reply."
Decent place for tea. Theor cakes always good.
The store manager and staff are incredibly slow and Bo chap. At first I thought there were many customers but it turns out they're just inefficient. Surprised cedele set such standards
The food is expensive but very good quality
I love coming here on Saturday morning for a good cup of coffee and a wonderful slice of cake. I love their Carrot Walnut Cake and Lemon Cloud Cake.
"The cakes here are really good. tried the gula melaka pandan, chocolate matcha, and red velvet cake. Chocolate matcha is very rich and pandan is very light and fresh :)"
Cedele is Always good. However in their urge to make food healthier the options are limited.. but good food despite
My weekly fix for sourdough bread!
Coffee average. Service average. Food is ok. If I had a choice of here or somewhere else I'll take the somewhere else.
Awesome brunch at Cedele! Power!
Good service and cosy ambience.
Great bread! Friendly cosy tidy aircond quiet relaxing high tea with attentive staff and bakery of natural yeast in romantuc ambience.
Soup was cold. Had to ask them to heat it up. Pasta was abysmal too. Didn't taste as gd as b4. Sad.
Good. More pastry variety better
Food is a bit expensive and very healthy. Good coffee and delicious cakes and pastries.
Poor counter service. Definitely not the place for a working lunch. No wifi or even a plug point to charge your devices.
"Cedele sells my favorite cakes. The outlet here is quite chill, and usually it doesn't take a long wait to get a seat..."
Cozy place that smells of baked goods
"Ordered via grabfood and gosh, what a terrible misrepresentation! I feel cheated and am terribly disappointed."
Good food and service.
Coffee is good. Wide selection. Freshly brewed. Lots of varieties of bread.
"Delicious food, somewhat pricey. Service can be improved, but overall gd experience."
Taste of food is average. Service can be better with more smiles
Service time is too slow......
Closed shop 9.30pm... Affordable cake and bread... Good for western people
Very small outlet with minimal staff. Take sometime to process the orders.
"Good desserts
Beetroot avocado veg burger is amazing
Friendly staff …"
Nice bakery. I had bought Cheese Scallion Scone and it was really nice and just taste fragnant.
"Good coffee, reasonable prices, good range of western style breakfasts."
Nice place for lunch .... I liked it bcos they have a healthy menu.
the manager very welcoming and friendly.. i forgot her name
"Great place for healthy meals, whether a light refreshment or a main meal."
"Decent cafe food, drinks with very friendly staff."
"Breads, cakes, muffins and pastries in quality consistent with what it has been.  Drop by for latte!"
The barista doesn’t handle well with crowds. Got my orders mixed up.
Friendly staffs but the empress chicken is very salty
Food's kinda meh. Although the staff were fantastic.
"Loved the corner window seats , fir catch up , meetings or self indulgence , not to mention good cakes , coffees and teas."
Nice cake
Waiting staffs seems to prefer doing your own things than their work.
Nice little cafe tucked away in a corner...  Good coffee. Highly recommended!
Nice ambience like before Covid time.
Decent but mediocre food.
2 counter staff. 10 people in queue. 20+minutes to place order.
Food is decent. Usually packed during peak hours.
A bit crammed but to be expected as we have safe measures in place.
"Food is not bad, but it's not worth the price."
Nice place to take a break
Avoid their Pandan cakes...
Good quality food but on the pricy side.
Nice place nice food and amazing coffee.
"eat the carrot cake, and try the juices. very interesting mixes of juices."
My favourite place for Sunday morning snack!
"3.80 for an espresso that was lukewarm, not worth it."
Nice cakes....Ondeh Once & carrot cakes
Good place to chill. Nice coffee
Healthy & fresh food at reasonable prices
Small place but wide variety of dishes.
Friendly service
Good selection of nice cakes
Appeasing and appetising bread for sale
Love their Red Velvet cake

Healthy breads to match your healthy soup.
Lovely place and your usual Cedele food
Staff were very friendly and attentive.
Took 20 mins to prepare 1 meal
"Healthy meals, cakes n salads...� …"
"Great Cakes, especially the Tiramisu!"
My fav place on sunday!
Sugar free bread and yummy cakes
Their cakes are good.
Very small space and limited seating.
Lovely sourdough bread ❤️❤️❤️
Was at Cedele for lunch after church service on Sun.

Cosy place to have coffer
Bad service

Always good to dine at cedele
Excellent pastries and coffee!
Reliably tasty.
Very nice coffee
Having coffee after lunch....

Terrible service. All the staff just ignored my existence. One even just looked at me the whole time and not attend to me and there was no one else in front of me  Was just getting a muffin too small a sale for them??

"Food quite decent in their taste. Ordered the pesto chicken thin wrap and sea salt cheese cake.
Chicken very dry cos is breast meat.  Could be more tender will be good. Environment a nice cafe to relax and have a cup of latte."
"Tables are far apart offering comfortable and safe ambiance.  I love the many choices of Sandwiches, Wraps/Thins and Sour dough bagel and the make your own  salad. Organic flat white and the healing garden tea are our favorite. A great place to enjoy healthy good... sandwich and salad and soup."
Standard of food has dropped. The chicken is dry and tasteless. Mushroom soup seems watered down. Staff always seemed overworked. Please do something about the flies in the shop. I see some flying around and even in the bread display.
"Cedele/ toss&turn used to give complementary sliced bread/ rolls with their soups, it was a nice welcoming touch. They have  stopped doing so.. pity."
The strawberry tart is not fresh and the staff had no attentive to my order. Miss out one order and to order again. Hope it will not happen again. As I can understand the working hours.
Terrible service. Unfriendly and unwelcoming. Better training required for its staff. Stood at the counter for 20mins and was completely ignored. Lucky for the company the food is good I guess…
Clean and not crowded. Their foods are around average. I value they have variety selection of cakes and bread loaves.
I came here three times at 7pm and always they say that it’s closed. Food isn’t available any time. Better to close than to open and have no food.
Queued for 10 min before being served. Wanted to buy baguette and garlic bread. Indian female staff was rude and  refused to slice baguette. In the end I had to give up buying the baguette. This is probably the only branch with rude staff …
The smoked salmon and broccoli was hard. Place was not crowded during lunch hr (1.30pm) Cost $14.80 with orange juice set
"Service staff is rude and curt. At 6pm, dinner time, very curtly informed me there’s no hot food left (strange), only pastries and cakes and drinks."
Service and food standards have dropped drastically when we visited on a Saturday night. We were served raw sweet potato in the salad and stale bread w the soup. I made a complain to the lady service staff who just mentioned to write in without even glancing at the food I brought infront of them or checking their own food. Pathetic!
"Very generous portion for salad bowl, taste is above average. But for sandwich, portion is kinda small. Bread for sandwich is below average."
Food was terrible. The ingredients were not fresh and some of them tasted off. The place is also dirty around where the food is served. One of the worst meals I’ve had in Singapore.
"Came here for a short break and bought a ice green tea. Service was bad, the Indian female worker dressed in black was rude and impolite. When I politely ask for a straw, she rudely rejected me and was impatient when I was ordering my …"

"Good quality food... ordered a Bagel with Spinach Cream Cheese at $5.50, a DIY soba bowl with 2 protein & 4 toppings at $10.80 plus a nice Roasted Cauliflower Soup (add $3+).  Quite promptly prepped & served.  The only thing I didn't quite …"
Good option for healthy food fans :) salads start from 10.50
Avocado on toast was tiny and poorly prepared. No service due to current covid guidelines but staff behind the counter was grumpy and looked resentful.
"Good option if you want to get a healthy meal. Their salad bowls are very tasty and the portion is pretty big. It costs around 12 SGD. Some of the staff is not very friendly, specially because they rush you when you're picking the ingredients. I went there after 8pm once and many ingredients were missing already."
"Food choices are standard fare, not particularly extensive. Taste-wise, above average. Service standards, average. They do sell some delicious soup though, but they do not provide butter with their bread slices, which is a bummer. …"
Most of the cakes are actually pretty nice. Agreed with most of the reviews on service.
"Super slow staff and not helpful at all. Although the food it is okay, only some comments on the hygiene and need to wash their hands more often when preparing other meals must be done better as they serve fresh ingredients. …"
One of my favorite salad places in Singapore
"The staff is Super unfriendly and didn’t seem to care about the food that they are serving. We ordered a açai smoothie bowl but it turns out to be a açai smoothie, very watery and didn’t taste right. It’s a bright red. The fruit doesn’t taste fresh. Never ever pay S$9.50 for this."
Grest portions but noodles a bit too salty.
"i was picking up a baked good from the store, which should just take a few minutes to make payment for. but the staff treats you like you're not there, lets some people go first even though they just walked in, and was extremely slow with …"
"Food is ok. They have warm and cold options. Salad and carb options.
The service is something else entirely. The wait can be really long coz there’s one person doing each part of the bowl. And while the first guy doing the salad …"
"Service at this outlet was absolutely terrible, and there was a fly in the display case at the front. Walked in intending to buy a few slices of cake, and was left standing there for 5 minutes while being ignored by the staff on duty. Even …"
Came here for coffee few times but was told that no more coffee after 730pm..yet shop closing time is 9pm... Why not close earlier so that the staff can go back rest early.
"great selection of bases, proteins & toppings"
"Only 4 stars because efficiency is BAD stood at counter for 5 mins and no one served me, but there were lots of staff just hanging around, maybe they are “busy” with something, but they were standing around so how busy are they? Not really. …"
"Overpriced bowl of veggies, less than average freshness. Some staff are not very friendly. Dont waste money on salad here, go down to NTUC to buy vegetables instead."
We had a salad each today. Sub standard services/food freshness.... My hubbie had diarrhoea after the salad and ice tea. Experience wasn't pleasant at the cashier. The cashier couldn't understand when i told her i want to top up my salad to …
"Their salads are really good, especially when it has fresh crunchy leaves and different plant-based options to choose from. Definitely worth the money as the portions are decent in size."
Delicious food but this cedele outlet cater more for the healthy conscious customers quick meals so do not expect cooked meal.
"Price increased for customised own salad. Most choices must pay extra!
Taste is average.
Staff is below average.
Will not go back again!"
"Great place to people watch while getting ur nutrients. Make your own salad or choose from one readily available options for a quick bite and recharge!
Rem to top it up w a smoothie."
Tried the 🍫 log cake slice for Xmas this year. Rich and creamy . Queue is served fas …
"If you like loud blaring music abruptly controlled by the staff, overpriced cold food and salads prepared unsanitarily, with passive aggressive service, this is the perfect place for you."
Nice food
As a fan of Cedele Bakery - I also like the food served at Toss and Turn at the Vivocity Branch. …
Soba/ noodle ran out already at only 7pm.
"Really surprised by the quality & size of this salad. Hard to get a ""healthy"" meal in Vivo. Will definitely be back."
Bought a romaine salad here and halfway through discovered the bottom of the bowl was full of dead ants. Disgusting. I guess I'll toss and turn in my bed tonight wondering what else was in my meal
"Great! Best salad I've had in Asia! A must visit if you love salad. Pricey, but worth it!"
"Toss and Turn restaurant sells salad meal at $11 for 1 protein, 2 base and 4 toppings a sumptuous meal."
Has healthy options which I like. Good coffee paired with a delicious cake. Service could be better
Like the salad bar here. Generous portion for price.
Was looking for healthier food but only the protein option is warm. A Good place for salad lovers.
Like their salad. The most worth salad I have ever eaten. But somehow the quality is not as good as their ION Orchard branch.
The iced chocolate was a total waste of money. There was hardly any taste of chocolate at all. It was so diluted.
I went there for bread. The selection is rather limited compared to the one at jelita cold storage
"Poor service staff . Very poor attitude need retrain.
The ondeh cake and carrot cake are not good. Not recommended for cakes"
Food is good. But service staff always seems like they are having a tough day
"Salad are Good but not friendly Staff.
They will make u feel uncomfortable."
Monosyllabic answers delivered with a deadpan expression 31/10 AM. Would recommend if you are fine with poor service
Good healthy food ...could do with more variety...the pork was good ...service could improve a bit
Salad lettuce was brown and service was slow and  recorude.Cannot recommend this location.
"Ordered for delivery. Very good salad, generous portion."
Decent. The food is nice but there is no standard of quantity of foods etc.
Healthy food doesn't mean its not tasty. nice place to go.
Good size servings and a lot of choices including hot dishes.
Nice and cosy cafe to chill and relax with friends over nice coffee/ tea and desserts.
I love their high protein salad. Fill you up!
Good service and spacious place. Willing to give customers more sauces.
Nice coffee and sandwich
Average.
Mixed salad. Average price range $10 to $15
Good food .very calm admosfare
Nice fresh sandwiches but a lil pricey!
More for improvement on service. 1st time and last to come. Good luck to all ppl working here.
The amount of seating space is good and sufficient for its customers.
Very tasty healthy salad bowls with many choices
Good value salad and ingredient selection
Great place to have Salad and other healthy food

A good place to hv a tasty healthy meal without the crowd.  The prawn salad plus avocado & accompanied by Mushroom Soup makes for a good feel evening meal .
Their cakes are as nice as other outlets but I find this outlet less crowded hence would prefer this then the others. A quieter corner compare the other cafes in Orchard.

Love the food here. Service can sometimes be a little slow due to lack of staff.
"decent food with great desserts, lassi was little lacked of ""uhm"" in the flavor, maybe has too many ingredients and the matching of the ingredients"
"Quiet Cafe in the orchard area. it has lots of seating area. I had an excellent red velvet cake (right level of moisture) and a tumeric honey latte (very interesting). They have other pastries, desserts and drinks options. A great place to seat and relax for a bit in the busy area of orchard road."
"The  service ,  hygiene and attitude of the workers are so bad that perhaps it's due to shortage of staff . …"
"Place might be a bit understaffed. Hard to get service when needed. But they still provided everything properly. Food was okay, portion is a little smaller than expected though"
Absolutely rubbish food and service! Every food item lacks flavour. Don’t even think of stepping inside the restaurant.
"Waited 30 mins for avo on toast.  When I asked the manager on the status of my order, he went off but never came back to update me on the status.  10 mins later I had to ask another staff.  At least she offered to give me soup for free.  No …"
"I dunno how this place survives. I was standing at the door for forever and no one seated me, staff was just chatting among themselves. I wanted to leave but thought to give them a chance. In the end I was seated but no one took my order. In the end I left, don’t think anyone realized too."
"Very nice and cozy environment, great service :) cauliflower soup is so so, beet chai is so so, turmeric latte is better."
"Lackluster service. We actual could have walked out without paying. We stood for >5 mins just waiting to pay. No one at the cashier. And when we finally found someone, she asked us if we’d like to place our order. Clearly, no idea that we …"
Quiet place for a weekday lunch but service is a little lack luster. Had the portobello and beef burger which was quite yummy and loved the caramelised onion.
"Love the bread and coffee here.. only thing is I do not like the wheat bread that was served with my burger..
Even though is a healthy option, I would prefer a plain old burger bun.. …"
"The thing I loved most is that they give the initiative for us to customize our meal. To be honest, my FAVOURITE thing there  was the sweet potato fries!!! It was so amazing- Crunchy, delicious (obviously), sweet, it's doesn't even need any sauce!! I love it. The service is also not bad! Please go there and enjoy your meals~♡"
Cosy environment with delicious high tea set for 2
"Went there for their high tea set. Service was terrible. Feels like the staff were not attentive to us as we were seated in the corner. Takes 10 minutes to even get a glass of water from them, after I walked up to the counter to ask. Staff …"
"Pay high with low quality food and drink while way down under at customer service i.e. a kind of rude (ignorance with inattentive), poor handling at serving and irresponsive. …"
"Went there with my parents yesterday, served with bad service. Everything was very slow, very hard to get the attention of the staff. When the food we ordered finally arrived, and we were about to dig in, realised no cutlery was provided at …"
"Have to wait for 45 minutes to get your food on Sunday, 24 April 2022. Service is bad."
The bread in the beef burger that I have ordered is burnt. The bread accompanied my soup is hard and cold. Disappointed with the standard. Don't recommend.
"Cedele has always been one of my favourite places....until I went to this one at Wheelock Place.  The quality of the food was not up to par with other branches.  We were served cold fries and the beef sandwich was mediocre.  Moreover, the service was horrendous.  Both the waiter and waitress were unfriendly and grumpy."
I go here often food is v good. Service is pathetic. There is typically 1 overworked waiter trying to serve everyone. The new counter staff is rude and passive aggressive. Some large lady called Sia or some such ignored me while I stood at …
"Friday night, way understaffed, they oversold all their desserts and it's currently a full house at 9pm with 3/4 of the tables waiting for desserts, which they don't have enough stock for and are now forced to sell the cakes from the front …"
I can attest all the bad reviews about Cedele's service and the service crew. The worse the review the truer it is in fact. I will never give any cent of business to Cedele. So many other wholesome cake shops and dessert places around. You are so NOT worth it Cedele!
"We went Cedele at Star so disappointed with limited selection!
1) Lassi (Not Available)
2) Cookie and Cream Milkshake (Not Available) Only Strawberry flavour …"
A nice and quiet place for brunch or tea time. Staff are friendly and services are prompt.
Nice and cosy ambience.  Ordered rosemary chicken for the first time and it is REALLY good. Would def go back again to try their special Christmas high tea which looks really instagramable.
Good food but TERRIBLE service from a rude and nasty waitress with short hair named Yen. Very bad attitude which ruined dining experience.
"The Chinese man and Indian man at Wheelock branch on 16 Nov have terrible body odour. Everytime they walk pass our table, we can smell the terrible body odour that lingers around before it fades. It is very disgusting. Never had I been to a …"
"Came here tonight for cakes and drinks. Severely understaffed. Took them 10 mins just to clear a table, while we stand at the table looking at the left overs. And the service staff walked away without placing new table mats and cutlery, as he was busy attending to other tables. The company can review the number of staff."
"Great spot for an afternoon tea. Service was quick and staff was helpful. Most importantly, the food was good, lovely cup of tea and nice coffee.  I have been a member of Cedele for many years and this will continue."
Nice place for dinner at cedele! The pork loin is tough though.
"Very quiet on a Sunday morning, Full Plate breakfast was good as was the other items we ordered. Very good English Breakfast tea. Quite expensive but enjoyable."
This is my family's favourite Cedele outlet because it is bigger and getting a table on a Sat morning is easier. My favourite eat here is the full works breakfast set. Adding on a piece if carrot cake would be perfect for me
"They have a set meal: soup, mains, and dessert for S$28++. I had a mushroom soup, pasta with fish in lemongrass sauce, and two scoops of ice cream with oat cookies. Overall, very good."
"Food was mediocre. Somehow, was not like before. I prefer other branch now. Staff was polite enough. Will take a while before I return."
"Terribly understaffed-waited an hour for food to come(everything at once)
Went to the counter to give our order but they kept telling us to return to our seats; Said they'd take it there but they never came
Food was so-so"
"Childs Hamburger. Half pattie (not even sliced horizontaly, it was broken in half.) Half a slice of cheese. Cold sweet potato fries.
""GOURMET"" Steak sandwich. 5 thin and totally inedible  raw slices of beef …"
Cozy place inside the shopping mall...nice chai beetroot latte
Great food and ambience. We were a bit neglected though. We weren't given utensils and service waters unlike the tables that sat before and after us.
Consistently good and in a nice area on Orchard. They're are countless franchises around here but this is one of my favourites. I but more expensive than the smaller version in your local mall but still reasonable. Recommended
Worst service I had in Singapore. Waiters were rude and barely spoke English. Slow service at lunch tine and thy refused to split the bill... my last time there
"Always loved eating here.  Food's great, well prepared, service is efficient and good, ambience pleasant.  Especially love their burgers! 😋� …"
"Staff's were friendly & polite & they greet their customer's & smile @ them and made customer's feel like their welcomed into the store unlike other cafe's food's & drink's were great & great view's from both side's of the window's , cosy & relaxing and cooling."
I like how spacious the place is to dine in at if you want to find a not crowded place to hang out with your friends.
Nice cafe for gathering with friends
Great place. Personal favorite - beef bacon works sandwich on round rye or pumpkin bread. Looks like a burger and tastes better than many burgers in town.
Waited half an hour for our food absolutely no apology from their staff. When the food finally came it was the wrong order. We had to go back to work so left with no lunch. Pathetic!
"I had hot drinks and cake. Service was not professional, service staff needs training."
Lovely dinning atmosphere and good service. Food is nice
Cedele's Chocolate Banana Espresso Cake. 1 is never enough.� …
"Great place for a snack and coffee with views of Orchard Road. A change from Starbucks and the like;  prices reasonable, table service."
Food was nice. Like this place. Just feel uncomfortable with staff member. Services change each time...
"Experienced an understaffed situation, the food we ordered looked better than it tasted. Not too bad overall but expected better."
"Not my first, but definitely my last visit to this outlet. Poor service and poor food quality, what a pity, they used to be decent."
Too expensive for its quality and poor service.
"Unlike other cedele outlets, have to pay service charge at this outlet, but service slower than the other outlets. Did not provide serviette."
A moderately chill place where one can see Orchard Ion from window. Menu is generally decent;
A monthly lunch meeting venue. No issues with food or staffing just a shame not see more diners guess sign of the Covid times
"Food was good, service was a little sloppy (confusing body language on where to sit, had to get my own baby chair) but it's understandable given the heavy weekend crowd"
"Unlike the other cedeles which are more quick takeaways ,this is a proper sit down restaurant and a great selection of healthy food.the vegetarian ravioli is yumm."
Nice and quiet place. High tea quite steel.  Tea time set is affordable
"Food pretty good. But there always seem to have a lack of staff, quite difficult to call for staff."
"Great food, service. Never fails to be one of our top places to eat at every weekend."
Loved the Vegan Falafel burger. One of the best I've had in a long time.
"Nice food, nice ambient."
"ordered salad ""take away"" and got spoiled avocado. Do they reaaly not care about returning customers???"
Very nice food!!!!
"Like it’s counterpart at Great World, absolutely appalling service. Food isn’t bad if you can ever get it."
Had the pumpkin n avocado salad. Yummy!!  Service was good too.
"It is located conveniently at Wheelock Place, good for a break from shopping, or get a good wholesome healthy meal, which tastes fantastic."
Good Food and nice cakes. Service has improved and pleased with the service.
"Just stay away from the French Toast($16), they were cold and soggy, the toast were probably prepared in a batch before hand and not made on the spot when you order."
Enjoy the ambience here much. good for dates
"Missed the yummy food and good membership bonuses, now it's all gone its really gone down the drain."
Food is delicious.  The pasta arrabiata is fresh and spicy.
Service is very poor at the cafe.  Had to chase people down to make an order.
Healthy dining at decent prices. Always a local fave .
"Very nice bread, breakfast is tasty and quite reasonable prices."
Good food and drinks
"Cozy environment. Serve drinks, pastry, cakes n Western food."
Bad coffee. Don’t even try.
I love the cakes and  loaf of bread there!
The best of the Cedele's in town! Great service!
Salad was really bad quality! Don't try
Nice ambience. Not so crowded even on weekend.
We ate carrot cake and coffees here. Relaxing place.
Nice atmosphere .... But service very slow
My Mrs & my favourite hangout! Never disappoints..
"Good wholesome food, interesting new meni"
Asked for milk with the tea 3 times and it finally came without an apology
Great relaxing place. Service is good
Good coffee and cakes but seems understaffed.
Good hide out but crowded on weekends.
Good food and service. Thank you!
Love their crab pasta.
Expensive and very small portions. Don't bother.
